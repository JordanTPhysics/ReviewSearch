I did some research and this seemed to be the best printer best price. Well after using the ink cartridges the printer will not recognize the new cartridges which were ordered from CANON!

I have never spoken with such a professional & knowledgeable person as this lady. I can not tell you how impressed I am with her professionalizum. I will quickly tell you that I had called a company that was representing themselves as a part of CANON! Seriously!!! They ended up talking me in to allowing them control of my computer. After talking to me about everything, (except what I called them for) concerning my Camon printer. they tried to sell me an anti virus system to the tune of almost $1k! I'm serious. Of course that was the premium package. The packages ranged from $299.00 & up. After about 30 minutes of being scared that someone over seas had all my confidential information...I finally decided to go into another room & call the 800 number provided on my Canon information sheet I received upon purchasing my printer. Chiquesia is the person who answered quickly & was my total savior from there on out. I quickly told her what this man was trying to do & asked her if she would speak with him. She was more than happy to help me. She was totally professional...& told him that they did not have a technical department in Atlanta GA where he had told me he was from!! Once he realized that she was not backing down & had all the right information he became rude & said he was going to hang up because I would not listen to him. Chiquesia saved the day!!! She was so amazing, professional & never raised her voice while putting this man in his place.

After that was over she explained in detail what to do so that would never happen again. She then said, ""now lets get that printer working for you again ma'am'! What a relief it is to get such great customer service. I was able to not only fix the issue I called in for...but after that was completed she asked me if there was anything else she could do for me before we finished the call?

I was cut off from the first CSR so I called back, started from scratch and after trying several things, the CSR and I realized that a fix was not to be without buying a new Printer Head. I could not locate my sales receipt and so he was not able to send me a new printer head for free. I asked if I could buy one and he said no that I would have to try and find one at a parts place that sells them. I am VERY frustrated knowing that Canon has the part I supposedly need and that they will not sell me the part.

I am loyal Canon DSLR user with a portfolio of lenses. I had given my 7d for routine servicing to your Pune Authorized Service centre ( ASF 1 ) on 30 July 2016 and collected it back next week.


However receipt ( bill ) for the payment of charges of Rs. 2900.00 was not provided as it could not be printed due to some "" technical reasons "" and I was promised that it shall be sent on email.

In the third week of Aug 2016, I had gone to the centre to collect my duly serviced 100-400 lens and reminded them about pending bill. I was once again assured that it shall be sent on email - it was not readily available that day also.

On 16th Sept. I reminded them once again on phone and email - no response.

On 19th Sept - when I called them, I received a Rude Reply "" Why are you making a big fuss about such a small issue... ? ""

Date of Purchase: 11/27/2015



I bought cannon SX520 HS camera [NEW].

When inserting memory card, it shows memory card error.

But same memory card working good in other cameras.

Memory card: 32GB, SanDisc, Class 10.



This camera was bought in US, now I am in India.

I took cannon to service center in India, they said USA warranty cannot be applied here.

Now they say PCB UNIT have to be replaced.



PCB UNIT defect and to be replace



Part Charges Rs.2518/-

Service Charge Rs.750/-

Service Tax Rs.105/-

Total Charges Rs.3373/-



I bought this for 99$ + tax.

I have not even took a single photo, it needs a service for 60$ (3373Rs + some other charge).

I can't afford so much for a repair, it is better to buy a new once than to use this repaired one (not canon again)




I contact both US and India support, both refused to help me.

They cant waive off the service charge.

They cant extend my warranty.

They cant even give discount for the repair.

Total waste of my money.

How could cannon sell such a useless product? Don't they test it before selling?

Just insert card and it shows Memory card error.

If my Toyota stopped working because the company no longer supported the car's software, how do you think that customers would feel? A scenario where consumers have to buy a new car due to lack of manufacturer software support sounds ridiculous. And yet this is what Canon is forcing me to do with my printer.

So why in the world should I buy another Canon product? You have just lost a loyal customer. I will now go out of my way to buy my printers (and spend THOUSANDS on ink) from one of your competitors.

I am trying to raise a complaint concerning your distributor Noble Equipment Est.



On 31-Aug-2015, we awarded a PO for a Canon Plotter delivery and installation in our plant in Ruwais.

Expected PO completion was on 14-Sept-2015



Since 29-Sept-2015, we are continuously requesting from Noble and Canon the CICPA registration in order to be able to issue a Letter of Assistance for them, but today after 1.5 months,

they inform us that this license has been expired and at least 1-2 months are required for renewal.




They proposed (is this a kind of joke ?) to move the plotter our side our premises, to install it (connected with what systems ?) and re-move it back to Ruwais.



You clearly understand that we are very dissatisfied with this co-operation.



Please find alternative and professional ways to asap satisfy your customer.



We remain at your disposal for any further clarifications required.



Thank you in advance

Best Regards

138,139,2015-09-08 08:52:00,"I bought a Canon PIXMA 2520 last week. Due to lack of time, I didn't set it up until today. It was pretty shocking and disheartening to find that there was no USB cable included. I wondered why Canon would offer a printer that cannot perform its primary function. That's odd. Yet the fact that this is not disclosed to the customer , at the time of purchase, is even more peculiar...
At this point, I was still quite optimistic and decided to call the customer service number and talk to Technical Support, since I only had on question. I waited for Technical Support for about 20 minutes and was disconnected, only to call back and get disconnected again. The first time I called back I thought it was a mistake that was an easy fix,but the operator( name escapes me right now) told me that you were experiencing high call volumes and It would be 20 minute wait. She also stated that there was no direct number to technical support or a supervisor, you know in case I was disconnected again. As a customer with a problem, I understood it as, "" I cannot do anything to help you, in case you are disconnected again, so just keep calling."" Well needless to say, I waited another 15 minutes and was disconnected again. Now, I am just confused. I did not understand what was going on, but I knew I had very little options. I could keep calling back and take my chances on getting disconnected or I could go it alone. I decided to try 3rd time. This time I spoke with an operator named Jennifer. We had a very bad connection and I could barely hear her. She told me that it was my connection because she could hear me. I thought that was a little rude and horribly stated. I asked her if I could talk to a supervisor, you know the same supervisor that was unavailable earlier. After waiting for another few minutes, a supervisor, named John, FROM TECHNICAL SUPPORT answered the phone. Even though he was really friendly, I felt quite INSULTED. I had been calling for almost an hour trying to speak to this exact person and department. Yet, when he picked up the phone and stated that he was a supervisor, not only did he really upset me his connection was CRYSTAL CLEAR. It made me feel like my business truly did not matter to Canon, and made me look like a complete idiot. Not only did I have to answer my own question, I waited an hour just to feel insulted and miscellaneous to you. More importantly is the principle behind things, I believed in Canon enough to buy their products only to feel like a moron for doing so; and to add insult to injury, I still cannot finish the setup because I don't have a USB cord.

I call customer service just in case. I spoke with Eric. He then tells me my order was in fact canceled. I asked how it could be canceled since I did not cancel it and my money was gone. He then said that a portion of the payment may have been charged already but it would be put back in my account. I told him that the full payment was taken and I did not cancel my order. He apologized like he wasn't sorry at all and made me feel like I was a waste of his time.
He told me the money would be put back into my account in the next few days and I could replace my order.
He could not tell me why my order was canceled. And told me to just wait and replace the order.

Also, since the printer is several years old none of their service center will service them and all the ""special tools"" have been thrown away. In other words ...

Installed software end of 2013 but printer refused to print- would not even activate- thought I had installed wrongly. Pressured for time and did not successfully finalise call to Cannon HelpDesk (in Philippines). No representation in Australia- suspicious already.



Mid 2014 tried again to make unit work - checked my install again and software operability- still no activation. Never successfully turned on- never printed a page, scanned a document, nothing.

Finally end of 2014 had time to follow issue- persevered with Phillipino HelpDesk. After multiple (6) calls got someone to listen to me- escalated to

Canon Australia Pty Ltd

who supposedly has escalated the complaint. I sent him copies of receipt to prove I had bought the product as requested.



I logged the complaint on 14 January- it's now 11 February- nearly a month- no further news, no resolution.



Situation is: only 1 year warranty so no warranty by time of claim. Further information is repair guy at local Cannon Centre advises scanner broken and unit will not activate until scanner replaced. This was the case in mid 2013 when I bought the unit from Dick Smith's, still the case at end 2013 when I first tried to make the unit work and remains the case today- the unit was never operable at time of purchase-` warranty or not.



My issues are 2 fold:

1. There is no one in Australia to talk to hence you, me the consumer finds it very difficult to place and follow a complaint- Cannon Australia have 'run away' with the money but are not prepared to represent the product themselves with Australian staff, instead you, me are farmed off to a Phillipino Help Desk who has to deal with the negative feedback undoubtedly for little money and heaps of responsibility. Interestingly enough, the retailer Dick Smith didn't want to know me either- they all but hung up on me.

2. The product was 'dead' when I bought it- regardless of warranty and the company Cannon are not responsible or accountable for it- they hide behind an overseas HelpDesk whilst the undoubtedly concentrate on selling further loads of products to Australians without having to be accountable or responsible for those. The $150 purchase price is not the issue- the real issue is that Cannon should stand behind the product they sell. Cannon clearly do not.



My conclusion- only deal with overseas companies who have both sales and technical assistance personnel in Australia. At least then you can actually confront the company that manufactured your faulty product and seek restitution or replacement.",neg,-0.12440476190476189,0.4480952380952381,"['bought', 'multi', 'function', 'cannon', 'unit', 'dick', 'smith', 'nth', 'queensland', 'australia', 'regional', 'centre', 'print', 'photo', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'instal', 'software', 'end', 'printer', 'refuse', 'print', 'would', 'even', 'activate', 'thought', 'instal', 'wrongly', 'pressure', 'time', 'successfully', 'finalise', 'call', 'cannon', 'helpdesk', 'philippine', 'representation', 'australia', 'suspicious', 'already', 'mid', 'try', 'make', 'unit', 'work', 'checked', 'install', 'software', 'operability', 'still', 'activation', 'never', 'successfully', 'turn', 'on', 'never', 'print', 'page', 'scan', 'document', 'nothing', 'finally', 'end', 'time', 'follow', 'issue', 'persevere', 'phillipino', 'helpdesk', 'multiple', 'call', 'get', 'someone', 'listen', 'me', 'escalate', 'john', 'vincent', 'gomez', 'customerservice', 'representative', 'customer', 'support', 'canon', 'australia', 'pty', 'ltd', 'p', 'w', 'wwwcanoncomau', 'social', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'youtube', 'supposedly', 'escalate', 'complaint', 'sent', 'copy', 'receipt', 'prove', 'bought', 'product', 'request', 'log', 'complaint', 'january', 'february', 'nearly', 'month', 'news', 'resolution', 'situation', 'year', 'warranty', 'warranty', 'time', 'claim', 'information', 'repair', 'guy', 'local', 'cannon', 'centre', 'advises', 'scanner', 'broken', 'unit', 'activate', 'scanner', 'replace', 'case', 'mid', 'bought', 'unit', 'dick', 'smith', 'still', 'case', 'end', 'first', 'try', 'make', 'unit', 'work', 'remains', 'case', 'today', 'unit', 'never', 'operable', 'time', 'purchase', 'warranty', 'issue', 'fold', 'one', 'australia', 'talk', 'hence', 'consumer', 'find', 'difficult', 'place', 'follow', 'complaint', 'cannon', 'australia', 'run', 'away', 'money', 'prepared', 'represent', 'product', 'australian', 'staff', 'instead', 'farm', 'phillipino', 'help', 'desk', 'deal', 'negative', 'feedback', 'undoubtedly', 'little', 'money', 'heap', 'responsibility', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'retailer', 'dick', 'smith', 'want', 'know', 'either', 'hungup', 'product', 'dead', 'bought', 'it', 'regardless', 'warranty', 'company', 'cannon', 'responsible', 'accountable', 'it', 'hide', 'behind', 'overseas', 'helpdesk', 'whilst', 'undoubtedly', 'concentrate', 'sell', 'load', 'product', 'australian', 'without', 'accountable', 'responsible', 'purchase', 'price', 'issue', 'real', 'issue', 'cannon', 'stand', 'behind', 'product', 'sell', 'cannon', 'clearly', 'conclusion', 'deal', 'overseas', 'company', 'sale', 'technical', 'assistance', 'personnel', 'australia', 'least', 'actually', 'confront', 'company', 'manufacture', 'faulty', 'product', 'seek', 'restitution', 'replacement']"

- Apparently 4 toners were delivered/ received before by Michelle â?? no surname at 5:00ish at Carey Place â?? Level 1 â?? Building 36 but we are closed at 4:30 pm

30/01/2015 - Called again Mel and them Mesh apparently there are 2 different female person, they sound the same, She gave me another Order No.4098072

- I called RNS Stores spoke to Nicole Beaton â?? needed original proof of delivery, she couldnâ??t see anything around

- I called Canon again â?? for a signed document as proof of delivery â?? CANON can not provide with proof of delivery

- Mesh said they will be delivered on Monday

- All CANON REPS were very apologetic but I have never received a phone call back as most of them offered and of course not delivery.

-

It seems that, CANON donâ??t know if a toner have been delivered or not, neither donâ??t know where we are located, if delivery has been done where are these toners. This is all very confursing and so frustrating.

My PowerShot SX 130Is will no longer transfer photos to my PC using a USB cable, which had been very convenient for the three and a half years I've owned the camera. A local shop said that the ""pins"" in the camera's USB port were broken and sold me a memory-card reader, which I'd not been able to get working for several months so had simply been inserting the memory card directly into the PC USB port. Last night the PC wasn't recognizing images on the memory card, despite repeated attempts, which seemed to leave no options. Though I had to place two calls and talk with two successive reps to get my issue resolved, both reps were attentive and patient. The first rep thought the problem was with the PC's internal card reader; it's a good thing I didn't take that advice as it would have entailed an $$$ session with my PC tech support, which would have been fruitless. I called Canon a few minutes after hanging up with rep #1 to ask an incidental question and was connected with rep #2, who was able to help me figure out that the memory-card reader just hadn't been seated precisely in the USB port of the PC. As soon as that was accomplished, all of the photos transferred fine, and, per above, this was my first successful use of the reader. Though it would have been ""more ideal"" if rep #1 had given the accurate diagnosis (a call about same issue a couple of months ago had not been helpful; that rep had suggested I upgrade my camera (!), the time spent on the phone with him wasn't wasted as it led to the solution from rep #2.

235,236,2013-05-27 04:04:00,"Worst product I ever bought was a Canon E60 video camera. Recommended to me by a TV news cameraman because they used to use it in the roadway at Bathurst for the big race. The thing blew up in 14 months.
Worst service I ever experienced was trying to get this fixed at Canon service in Melbourne.

The first question they asked was did I get it serviced regularly? What the copulation does that matter when it was the power supply that blew up? How do you service a solid state power supply? Being an electronics sevice tech for 5 years I think I have a pretty good idea what servicing does and doesn't do. It's like the wing mirror falls off your car and they say ""did you keep the tyres pumped up? Huh?
So these idiots at Canon in Melbourne tell me it's going to be six months before they can get a part for a 14 month old camera that has hardly any use.
I said not good enough. Give me my money back then and I will go and buy a different brand camera.
A week later they offer me a replacement camera from their fine Canon stable. Not the Made in Japan model that I had but some piece of rubbish from Korea with a non adjustable view finder and half the features missing of my own camera, oh, and I can keep the accessories from my old camera. Wouldn't want to burden you with a new battery or power supply now would we?
So I stupidly said yeah over the phone and when it turned up I rang them up and said 'thanks for screwing me"" now when are you going to fix my camera and by the way you can have the piece of Korean rubbish back. So they said six months and were pretty annoyed that I wouldn't accept their genorousity of a brand new camera. It did get fixed within the month but the colour was like a rainbow every time I used it in other words they screwed it. Calling the service manager got me nowhere other than an earful of abuse so I said that I would tell everyone I know what rubbbish Canon is. I have done that for more than 10 years now. I reckon I have told a thousand people. If you read this you are one more. Don't buy a Canon and certainly don't expect service because you won't get any.

So I gave it to my friend and he called to Bangalore Canon showroom they told ""for service U can give to matha electronics who is authorized service center of canon"" so he followed them. then after few days i got call fro that "" your cameras Shutter problem occurred and it will be charged 5500+ including service charge.""

Then i got my camera and in Mirror i found lot of dust. After seeing this My heart broken. because I passion about photography. I love photography and I won t give my camera to anyone.

So it needs 6576+13768. i unconscious for some time and came to this world. ufff....actually My camera is Canon 1000D and invested only 22500. now its repair cost around 20K plus. so again I called them and informed all setails what i have got. that time they told its around 9k plus to repair your camera body. now which one should i believe? 13k or 9k? really they are irresponsible people. I informed them that ""please bring it to my camera with Body repair"" ITs only for the sake of am holding that Canon Camera.

Took the camera out in to the field, using a mixture of lens, these being a 70/200F4L, 300f4L, 28/135IS and a Sigma 500F4.5, please note at this point all of these lens work a OK with the with the 50D & the 1D MKII.

On the MK III all I got was ""soft"" images no matter what I tried, called in to Canon RCC in Elstree to have the focus checked, the item was ready after 9 days, collected and paid for the item, before I left, I found out where I had asked them to fit a new focusing screen they had missed out doing so, so I waited whilst this was done.

When back out into the field again (wildlife) by the way, image quality no better, when back to Canon RCC and saw a team leader of was far from helpful, after a long ""debate"" he took the 300 and 500 lens upstairs to check the calibration, when he came down he informed me that the camera was back focusing by 5cm and it was fixed, I was not convinced and asked to do test shots outside, this request was met with a lot of resistance but finally he agree as a senior technician was in the building from head office.

I let him set the camera up on my tripod outside, he even measured the distance from the camera to the subject with a laser range finder, he tried a number of different setting and the then agreed the image qualify was still soft and that the job, now for the second time was still not right, so all the kit except the 500F4.5 is back at Canon.

I spoke to Sigma UK who`s attitude was much better, they said the could match the 500 to the 1D body but them it would not be any good with the other bodies, not a lot of good, what does it take to get through to Canon that the item has a focus issue!!

I purchased an HF 200 Camcorder 2 years ago for roughly $800. It is outisde of warranty, but Canon has a service center you can ship your product to for repairs. You would expect a Canon product to last more than 2 years, but nothing is made well anymore. With that said, recently the camera only operates when plugged into the wall, and the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge. When I called Canon tech support they told me that the battery or the camera could be defective, they wouldn't ber able to tell unless I sent it in. Internet search shows that replacement batteries range from $15-$90. After speaking to Canon I figured my best bet was to have them look at it and let me know what the issue was before I wasted $ on a new battery. A few days after I shipped my camera to Canon I received a letter from them stating I should pay $285 to have the camera restored to factory condition, however the letter does not tell me what is wwrong with the camera. Now, I ask you, would you take your car to a mechanic and give him $ BEFORE he even tells you whats wrong and provides an estimate for the specific job, or would you expect to pay him AFTER he at least gives you an assessment of the problem and perfoemed the job? When I called the 866 number on the letter after reading the letter I spoke to a supervisor at Canon who simply told me this was there procedure and the only option for their customers. So basically they take your $285 and THEN go ahead and look at the camera and figure out whats wrong. So if it happend to be that only the battery needed to be replaced, guess what, you just paid $285 for a battery. This is simply unaccepltable. I understand why they want the money before they do the repair, but atleast look at the camera and tell me what's WRONG first!! I paid the cost to ship the camara to them, the least they can do is look at it and give me a fair estimate for the work involved. I guess it goes to show you that Canon does NOT build their products to last, and the support provided to customers is in the realm of a 'used car lot'.

Being that fax happened to fall in the half that worked, they said there was nothing they could do until something concrete was determined to be wrong. I thought to myself 'fine, I'll just send whatever faxes I can, and I can still use the printer which was working properly'. Last week, the faxing function completely stopped working altogether, as the input feed stopped transmitting after I hit ""start"", where the machine started beeping and an orange warning light came on. I called customer service again. The agent put me on hold and never came back on the line. I call again and got another agent who then started going off on all tangents about how intricate the machine was and that if I was experiencing a problem, it had to be with my phone carrier. When I objected to what he was saying had anything to do with my problem, he became rude and kept persisting about how knowledgeable he was about phone carriers and that the problem I was experiencing had nothing to do with the machine itself.

270,271,2012-04-13 00:21:00,"Dear All,
I have a serious quality problem with Canon Pixma IP4850 printer from the beginning of first use. I couldn't solve this problem for three months.

I bought a Canon Pixma IP4850 printer from your authorized seller Bimeks Forum in Izmir (Turkey) with two years warranty, but from the beginning of first use there is an unacceptable vertical line (distortion) for about 1 cm thickness at the right side of each paper.

I sent the product to the Canon Technical Service (Servus; www.servus.com.tr) two times for changing with the new one. At the first time they told me that there was no problem and send me back without doing nothing. It takes one month long, then I sent it back again second times. They told me that it was repaired. It takes another one month long again too. Then I called the customer support of Servus and I told them I couldn't accept this repaired product. I bought it as a new and from the beginning of first use there is a problem, so I need a new one. Then they told me that your request would be considered within 3-5 days, but nobody has contacted with me. Now they are telling to me that there is no problem with your printer and they changed their system record (60099024) from ""repaired"" to ""delivered"". They told me that your printer was not repaired. This status can be checked from the internet (www.yaziciminnesivar.com) The product is still waiting in the store (Bimeks) now.

As a result, This kind of behaviors are not well-intentioned. Canon Customer Service in Turkey is not deserved to be a part of Canon brand. Canon brand and customers are damaging such a this kind of behaviors.

CANON


I Mr. Hitesh Chevli Customer of “CANON PSA 2200” with Serial No. :- 428064034106 wants to lets you know that I had bought this camera on 01/04/2012 and I complained regarding the blurring of images captured to the Canon shop from where I had purchased the camera via telephonic conversation and they wants view the captured images and so for them I again visited the Canon showroom on 06/04/2012 situated at Rahul Raj Mall, Piplod, Surat – Gujarat. And they viewed the image with conformation that “They are Getting Blurred”.

I want canon to be known that I had bought 14 MP PSA 2200 Camera for better resolution and better picture quality but I am very unsatisfied with the results provided to me by this camera. “Canon is not fulfilling the promises done about the picture quality and resolution”. I do have another piece of canon which is 7.1 MP Canon Power Shot A470 which provide the Excellent images when ever captured and also with finest details and clarity which is not seen to me in newly bought piece so if I won’t be able to get better picture then my old cam then what’s the reason for me to buy the new cam its totally hopeless and I am very unsatisfied by PSA 2200.

I am sending you the pic’s captured by both the camera’s at the same time and place with same vision in front of camera and also without any extra lightening and all so “lets the pictures speaks the truth” You can compare both of them as you wish even you can compare them by zooming them to the full extent into your PC and let me get known kind heartedly about the best one in both…..

Also I am sending you the “Voice Recording” for the conversation held between your employ and me regarding the fault is concern you can hear this conversation and hear the kind of speech and words used by your employ when we talked regarding the fault and he told us that he can’t do the Cash Back as per company’s policies and want us to keep the camera with him for “ 3 Long Days ” and your employ want my Brand new camera to be screwed to search where the problem actually is…..???

Basically I don’t want my new cam to be screwed for unnecessary reason because I had bought this camera after spending 5330/- Rupees. “I want better Replacement as per my choice and functions or otherwise I want Cash back” do what so ever seems to be better for you.

I also wants canon to know that the basic comparison of picture quality, sharpness, resolution, colors, contrast was being compared with no other brand then canon itself.

So what is want is to give me “CASHBACK” so that I can prefer some other brands (i.e. Nikon/Sony) so that I can get the quality what I want.

And also your employs doesn’t have any sense to talk with the customer regarding the fault is concern and they doesn’t provide the qualitative feedback for the genuine reason.

I want you to hear the recorded conversation which was recorded at canon shop on 07/04/2012 at 7:30 pm to 8:00 pm. & the person in conversation are Hitesh Chevli (Customer) and your employ Sunil Sonar (Owner/Employ….???). And he also refused to provide a written sheet for not giving the Cash Back also when we asked him to provide the mail id of some concerned person he immediately refused to give their ID and Phone No.

Basically he doesn’t want us to write our query to you b’coz he’s really afraid…..!!!
Your employ also challenged us to fight against the company’s premises.
If my Problem is not solved within 2 big days I’ll definitely forward this conversation and mail to “Media” and also provide Canon to have the best publicity ever being done by Canon itself.

I don’t know whether this publicity will be afforded by canon or not…..!!!

I want you to contact me on my phone no. : +91 9228121587 as soon as possible. I am writing this letter and sending you the attachment on the same day night around 11:00 pm to know whether company’s employ are reading mails or their mail id’s are just for showing that we solve problems but basically it’s all fake and unrealistic & simple terms of fooling the Genuine Customers for unwanted reasons….!!!

I am eagerly waiting for your call…..!!!

312,313,2018-10-07 09:52:00,"I am very pleased with Canon customer service. I didn't always get the help I hoped for, but their solutions to my problems were more than reasonable. In one case, my MF laser printer rejected a new Canon cartridge. The printer had been used little, but was out of warranty. They sent a new cartridge overnight, but the problem wasn't resolved. At that point, they felt the cost to repair would be more than the printer was worth. They offered a very good upgrade price on a newer model. Because the printer had been used very little, I investigated further and concluded the problem was shipping damage that didn't show up until I tried to change the cartridge. Not Canon's fault. Just bad luck for me. They did everything reasonable to help.

In another case, after several years of use, the flash on my Canon SX50 quit working. Technical support made a couple of suggestions, but none worked. Again, the cost to just look at the camera would exceed the value. They offered an upgrade to a refurbished SX60 at a very good price, so I took it.

My third experience was my ""new"" SX60. I only had it a week, when my strap gave way and the camera hit the sidewalk with the lens out. The only visible damage was a very small scratch on front of the lens assembly. However, the lens would zoom in and out a few times before displaying a ""lens error"" and shutting down. I called technical support where they made a couple of suggestions that didn't help. Then they sent me a prepaid return shipping label to send the camera back. They evaluated the camera the same day and told me the damage was not covered by warranty, but for under $100 they would send me a new or refurbished camera. I agreed and within two days I had a replacement camera, within a week of when I originally damaged it. At first, I thought the strap that gave way was poorly designed, but I've since determined I attached the strap wrong.

As a former online technician from several years ago and after working 23 years for an international computer corporation, I know what customer service and good technical support means, both to the corporation and to the customers.

I have just completed a technical call with Joel and must take the opportunity to grade him as five stars out of a possible 5 stars. Joel was articulate, patient, completely knowledgeable about my issues requiring a patch upgrade due to Win 10 incompatibility issue. There were several steps for upgrading the Canon app, getting new drivers downloaded and the patch installed correctly. Joel did a superb job in walking me through each part of the process AND explained why as we did it. He could have made assumptions about what I should know, he could have put me on hold while waiting for me to reboot the system, etc., etc. ... But, he stayed online, waited patiently, and proceeded when I was ready. By the way, I had to ask him how I could leave a review of our work today. I don't mind it when service personnel have asked me to leave comments in previous calls but I think it shows an extra level of class and professionalism to allow the customer to request that information.

So, kudos to Joel for a job extremely well done and kudos to Canon for doing it right.

This is why I hold Canon as my first go to for products...starting with the purchase of my first (and still working) Canon FT QL camera purchased at the PX in Danang, RVN in 1969.

Keep up the good work. Take care of your techs. This is not easy work and they are the first line after point of sale, to represent you to your customer base and the public.

Keep the Joels of your corporation and feed them well....I'll be looking for them in the future.

After a not-so positive experience last year dealing with a tax exampt purchase, Tomica encouraged me to fax in my tax exempt form, assuring me that she would get it. That did not happen last year. It took 6 months to get my camera back due to someone last year NOT receiving my form several times.

Not only did Tomica receive my fax, she was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining the process. She really just made my day and instilled a vote of confidence in customer service at Canon!

I thoroughly enjoyed working with her and hope that I will get an opportunity to work with her again if any of my cameras break down!

Recently I had to change operating system on my Apple Macbook Pro which is 7 years old doing so it deleted all my wifi operating printers off line especially my workhorse MX860. I called canon for help and got an extremely knowledgeable tech support rep who helped me restore the MX 860 to wifi operation. the your lady's name was Barbra. Not only was she super knowledgeable about the technicalities but she was pleasant and a true professional. If I we're an employer I would certainly want her on my team. Canon certainly hit the jackpot when they hired this young lady. Thanks to her the process of getting my printer back on wifi and full use.I'm very grateful. I've alway relied on Canon products for my printer and photographic needs and the tech support is super especially with representative like Barbra. Thank you Canon, and thank you Barbra for your kindness and help.

HOWEVER,this is to underline the professionalism of 1 of your representatives. On May 28/29th, Photo Laplante, 350 Boul des Laurentides, Laval,Qc

held a sales and work shops. I love photography and my principal tools are: on/off button, zoom, macro... get my point? but I love taking pictures. I therefore seized the opportunity to ask a couple of questions to the Canon representative (unfortunately did not ask his name): he was so very nice, not condescending at all and explained everything simply, clearly and with a smile. So I would like to thank him and let you know how well he represented the company.

424,425,2016-06-07 12:27:00,"Without giving me the opportunity to decline, my computer recently ""upgraded"" itself to Windows 10. In reality, so far, it's been more of a downgrade.

Afterward, I was unable to use my Canon printer. I took my laptop to the Geek Squad at Best Buy, but the representative told me that my printer was now obsolete and could not be added to Windows 10 - i.e., my only options were: 1) to have them try to reinstall Windows 7 (a 10-day process, that may or may not work and which, besides tying up my computer, would possibly cause me to lose data) or, 2) I could do the logical thing - purchase a new printer and toss a perfectly good one.


I chose a third option - call the Canon helpline, which I did yesterday. Two of the Canon reps (Natalia - Station #647) and Alicia (Station #659) talked me through the complicated process of removing and replacing my printer to accommodate Windows 10. Natalia worked with me initially and before we hung up (after about half-an-hour), we tested the printer for printing and scanning and all was well.

As soon as I hung up, the system affecting the printer froze. So, I placed another call to Canon and spoke with Alicia, who told me that that was also a common problem with Windows 10. She talked me through that process, as with the initial process was also complicated, and was able to get my printer back up and running after about another 15-20 minutes.

I am really impressed with the staff at Canon and cannot say enough good about how patient and cheerful both Natalia and Alicia were with me as we worked to correct this very aggravating problem. I don't know how they knew what they were doing, but I sure as Hell would never have had a clue about how to fix the problem on my own.

Special thanks to both ladies. They deserve raises or bonuses, or both!!!

On 2/18/2016 I purchased a new imac and Canon printer in Kona, Hawaii. I was not too familiar with an imac and was having problems installing a new Canon printer. Apple suggested I contact Canon so I called Canon. I reached a tech support employee named Cameron at station 257. He was polite, helpful and patient.



1. Cameron helped me navigate the imac and download the Drivers successfully.



2. I was never passed to another employee.



3. Your Employee was patient, kind and was never condescending.



4. I will buy Canon products again based on my experience with Cameron.

The second was with the fax function, I spent more than an hour on the phone with technical support and the problem was not fully resolved. although the fax feature worked properly, the telephone priority was not set up properly as incoming phone calls were unanswerable as the caller received only a fax tone. I called again and ended up withe a tech support person who was rude, disinterested and i must say quite incompetent.

when i once again had the time to allocate to resolving this ongoing problem i called again. Quite fortunately I reached a tech support person By the name of Terrell (station x265).

He went through quite a number of questions before attempting problem resolution. Terrell inquired about the settings of bothe the MX92 and my Panasonic DECT 6.0 telephone system and associated answering machine. Asked to determine how the phone was connected to the wall jack or modem, he changed the settings on my MX922, which were erroneously set up by the previous tech support person I spoke with 2 weeks ago and then he asked about my answering machine settings. I told him I was unsure how to check and then he asked me for the model number of the Panasonic telephone/answering system and he went online to find the owners manual and quite proficiently and patiently walked me through the proper setup of the Panasonic telephone/answering system.

He was patient while I tried to follow his instructions, he was clear in instructing me on how to replace the print head from the old unit to the new unit, and in getting everything all set up. He very kindly waited on the line while I tested the unit to make sure it was working.

I am very happy with Canon so far, in spite of my printer needing to be replaced in a relatively short time. The fact that I didn't have to drive around get it fixed, and that the new unit was sent to me with the trust that I would send the old one back made it much more convenient.
