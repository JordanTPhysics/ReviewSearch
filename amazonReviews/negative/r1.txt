The quality of this product is shocking. If you remember battleships from being a kid, the game itself is just as good. But whoever’s in charge of manufacturing needs to be sacked. It’s hard to imagine how you could make this product any worse. The cases are cheap, flimsy plastic. The pegs are ill filling, badly shaped cheap plastic. The clip in radar section mounts on cheap plastic clips that are too small and flimsy. The packaging is too big with wasted space in the box. The game is great but the product is a massive letdown. I’ve returned mine.
