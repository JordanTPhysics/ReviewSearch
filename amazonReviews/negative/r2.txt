Just got this today, the box and photos looked great so I got it to play with my younger brother.

Biggest lesson from this product is do not judge a book by it's cover, this looks like it would be awesome but it's just an overpriced, weak and flimsy piece of plastic.

The design is terrible, all it takes is the slightest knock and half the pieces fall out of the slots. (Atleast on the bottom gray area, the top clear plastic area is pretty sturdy in contrast)

The bits to store the white and red tokens are very small, and mix up incredibly easily especially once you shut the box. It's a slight inconvenience but these things add up.

With the price tag I'd atleast expect to get a game that doesn't need you to put it back together every few minutes.

Avoid this, you can get much better value elsewhere
