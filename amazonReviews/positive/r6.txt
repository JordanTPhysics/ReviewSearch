5 of us played this game at a socially distanced birthday games night, we ranged in ages from 28-67 but it's perfect for all ages!

It was really quick and easy to set up, and was simple to pick up (which was handy after a few drinks). The whole group really loved the the design, particularly the packaging!!! We had a great time playing with the big laughs coming from hearing the rest of the groups answers. It's a great ice breaker game too!

This game would be a great one to play at any social gathering. It's also worth noting that it can very easily be played socially distant too, which isn't always the case for lots of games so handy during these times!
