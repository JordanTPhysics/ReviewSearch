I absolutely love the concept of this game and gameplay is fun for any family event. However I cant give it 5 stars because the questions get "tired" very quickly. Four of us played it 5-6 times yesterday as it was such fun. But we have already got through half the questions. We experimented with shuffling and reusing questions as we wanted to keep a good quantity of new ones back for Christmas but it doesnt work as well as we had hoped it would. So bottom line is that this is a great game but doesnt keep fresh as long as it should do for the price. Please double the number of questions.
