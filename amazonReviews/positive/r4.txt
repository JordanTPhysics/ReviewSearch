This game has been around for a long time. It can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. It does have small pieces so parents need to be careful with younger children as there is a chocking hazard. That aside, it is a strategy game which has provided hours of amusement.
The boards require a small amount of self assembly. The transfers are a little flimsy and, due to the length, for me, a little difficult to put on neatly. The inner section is meant to click into place. Again, I found this a bit difficult as I have arthritis in my hands. However, once assembled it works well and we shall see how it goes in use. There are spare pieces as not all of the markers fit comfortably in the playing boxes. Not a bad thing as these do get lost over time.
