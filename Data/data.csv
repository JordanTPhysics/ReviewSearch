Sometimes the app is not that great with suggesting shows that you may like. I also don’t like how many of the representation matters programs for ** people are centered around police violence. It’s very triggering to see that every time you watch a movie. I’ve noticed in many of Netflix programming that they like to add in these triggering scenes and it’s becoming quite predictable. Overall the app is good and is a good alternative to cable. We need more light hearted programming. Less focused on social themes just some funny shows to watch.,2021-09-18,4,24

I do not like how much the monthly fee go up each year. I am paying about $15 each month.

I am on medications that do not give me much time to go outdoors. I spend most of my time just relaxing while in pain. Pain sometimes so bad that I cannot do much. Netflix offers a wide variety of programs that not only pique my interest but allows me for times to forget the pains and uneasiness that I go through daily also allowing me times to stay informed of things that are going on outside and in the world today. I hope that their continued variety they offer will make things more exciting and bearable to get me through the hard times I face now and in the future. May the Lord bless us all especially those facing the same as myself. Thank you for this opportunity today for being able to voice my opinion. May this help others.",2021-09-08,5,16

We have been subscribers for what seems like a lifetime and have seen our monthly fees well over double (i.e. - increase by over 100%) during that time. Kind of tired about hearing about all the great content they deliver as every time they raise their fees for standard service by a $1.00 per month, they gross another $200 million per month or $2.4 Billion annually based upon their approximately 200 million customers. For that kind of cash, they should offer much better!

Didn't fix the problem cause they don't want to hear that it's their service that is the problem and until they understand they have a problem it will not be fixed. No type of credit for days of it not working, I have the biggest package they have and I don't know why I even pay them 5 a month much less the 17. Then when you call to get fix they blame all others and talk to you like you stupid. They need better training. They then said they don't have troubleshooting department, I said, ""Well there is the problem,"" I then started to tell her how much it would help to have it then guess what? She was now the troubleshooting department, really lol. Now just trying to get me to shut up 2 hours on phone and I still have to keep unplugging ** and restarting it.

After interrogating the customer service rep it was clear they were going to INCREASE my rate when I resubscribed. The CS rep failed to tell me I could simply change my payment method in my Netflix account (I found that out myself) even after being asked several times.

More language options. More anime even, a guilty pleasure of mine. As of the past year, it's gone downhill though. They've upped the price while removing a lot of my favorite shows. What used to be the place where I could catch up on shows I loved and rewatch old favorites or binge new series, has become a place of frustration as they literally remove shows while I'm in the middle of watching them. And there isn't even a warning! Many shows like Switched at Birth, Being Human, and so many more have been removed.

I never had a problem returning DVDs, typically showing returned within a few days. The new release DVDs weren't usually available until a few weeks after being publicly released so I found I didn't use the service as much as I wanted so decided to cancel. I followed all directions and requested no further DVDs be sent. Netflix noted they sent a DVD after cancel, I listed this as never received and I returned my last DVD in time. Netflix has charged me for nonreturn of a DVD after canceling. After researching online this appears to be Netflix's standard business practice. Buyer beware, if canceling, clear your queue and return all DVDs where Netflix acknowledges receipt and then cancel so you are not charged for a ""nonreturned"" DVD.

He like controls the whole show in and always asking the random ""judges"" and ""chefs"" questions. These two ""titles"" are great chefs in their country, and they wanted a chance to get on Netflix, but Netflix put their people under their script.

I was told by floor manager Michael in Tampa, FL, customer service that I could not save my $50 plus balance from being reduced to nothing during the time I will be without internet, even after I canceled my subscription.

We've endured price increase after price increase. We've been patient and understanding about half of our choices not being available on Netflix... they are on the DVD format... just not at Netflix... that's the first issue. However, what we are finding more and more often in the last year or two... which is much more frustrating... is that we now find ourselves waiting not just for weeks, but for MONTHS, for one disc in our queue. Mind you, this is something that is on DVD, that Netflix has, that they let us add to our queue... but one disc has been on 'very long wait' for three months now. This happens a lot!!!

You get Short wait, long wait or very long wait for disc #1 of a DVD season. What their system wants to say is that customers always want to watch the first disc of a TV season before getting the second disc. So let's say that you have a 5 disc TV season in your queue. That's 5 individual discs. Netflix tags disc #1 as long wait and none of the discs for the season are shipped. But if you change the sequence in your queue from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 you will get 2 - 5 pretty much immediately and disc #1 is left hanging as ""long wait"". If you want to give Netflix the benefit of a great doubt, you will have to believe that Netflix carries 1 copy of disc 1 and 50 copies of disc 2.

I was able to use the service as time permitted with no issues. Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether. The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card... I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.

When the prices per month started going up, my parents decided to cancel. I still liked watching shows and movies there so I started my own account and paid for it myself. I've been doing that for a few years since I was in high school. I loved being able to watch the movies and shows they had because there were a lot of them. However, nearly every month my favorites are being removed from Netflix and replaced with crappy rated ones or originals. I like that Netflix is branching out and making their own brand, but only about half of them are actually decent. It's getting to a point where I can't find anything worth watching. And on top of that, I'm paying $9 a month and increasing. That is way too much to be paying for limited, bad titles. They need to figure it out because I'm this close to switching to Hulu.",2017-05-24,2,10

My biggest complaint is with their DVD service. In the early days when they just had DVD rentals, I would have a long list of DVDs that I wanted and the order I wanted them sent. In that list there were always some that were indicated to be either having a short wait, long wait or extremely long wait. In the early days of my subscription when these wait items made it to the top of my list they would just go down to the next items and then send them.

My teenage girl wants to watch some shows during the summer break. We didn't want her to access my credit on file so we decided to buy some Netflix gift cards. We thought she can use the account for three months then we can put the account on hold while she's in school. We called their customer service, ask if we can freeze our account and if they can hold the remainder balance of my gift card until we reinstate. Rep responded: ""Unfortunately, we cannot put your subscription on hold. You can cancel your account but any remaining credits will be void."" Per REP there is no way for us to hold your account or your credits.

It offered new and refreshing shows and movies that were not readily available online or on cable channels with HD quality such as Jane the Virgin, Jessica Jones, How to Get Away with Murder, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Daredevil, etc. It was entertaining following such shows and I liked that Netflix recommended movies and shows based on my viewing preferences. That introduced me to similar shows that were worth checking out. Another good point is Netflix allows various users to create their own account and chose and save the shows they like.

Got a notification via email that the Mindy Project Season 4 was now online. Later that night starting watching it. After about 4.5 episodes watched, all of a sudden the screen went blank and some sort of error message appeared. Well after chatting with customer support the show was yanked because the episodes were not in order. 24 hours later still Season 4 was not up. Contacted them once again and told soon but given no real info. Seriously? Right in the middle of a show and it gets yanked and no one knows when it will be back again?

I admit to making the following error: The first person I spoke with, I gave the incorrect information as to the series I was attempting to watch. I told her Justified, which is not on Netflix. After realizing my mistake, I told her the correct series I was having trouble with. However, she could not get off Justifed. Kept going back saying it is not a Netflix series. We agreed on that over and over. So, I said I will just start a new call and not mention Justified. Second call I got Avery. He determined that my problem was with Netflix original series. Without all the gory details, by the time Avery got done with me, I had no sound on any station due to instructions from Avery.

Apparently, only the primary account holder's profile (me) can get blu-rays; the other profile can only get regular DVD's. I called the Netflix help center and the tech I talked to was no help at all. He couldn't understand why I would want two profiles anyway. I explained that my husband and I have different tastes in movies so the profiles are configured for the types of movies we each want to see. He also showed that I was charged for the next month on my credit card even though my free trial doesn't end until June 17, 2015. He said he removed the charge so I can cancel my membership and rejoin to see if that makes any difference.

They may be a large company, but still treat customers like they're a small business. I like that. I had a pleasant conversation with a Netflix rep about the possibility for changing my payment date. Though I understood they couldn't do that at the time, it was nice that they were able to tell me that and explain why rather than having a list of responses and just copying and pasting into the message field (which I wouldn't be surprised if some companies actually do). Netflix customer service really is some of the best service and help you can get. I'd say their help surpasses that of Xfinity/Comcast.

I have been with netflix for years and have been happy with them until I tried to get a year subscription from them. After having to call them, as I couldn't find the subscriptions in my account, I had to call them. I was told they no longer do subscriptions but I could look up who was selling gift cards and could purchase them. He wasn't even sure who had them but did say he thought Best Buy. I told him that I had been getting my year subscriptions from them, which he had confirmed I had, but said that they were no longer able to do that. He didn't know why and said this must be something new they are doing. Usually you got a discount for buying a year in advance, which ran under $100. But now they only sell gift cards in $30 and $60 increments which with them raising new subscriptions to around $11 a month, you can't even get a year unless you get 2 cards at $60 dollars and one more at $30 dollars.

She empathized with me and instructed me to call the Phone Call Center and said they would likely be able to help me. I Googled online and can see that people have received refunds before. On the phone, I spoke with a man who promised to help, asked me to go back into my office (I had been standing in the hall making the call while at work) and I had to Google my local TD Bank's phone number. He asked for their fax, which I couldn't find online, so he took the number instead, and said he would send them the proper information to show them they should refund my $35.

After researching both accounts, I noted that there were 3 occurrences. I immediately called Netflix to cancel one of them and see about a credit or refund for the extra 3 payments that were made. Both the customer service rep and his higher up stuck to the Netflix rule of only granting one credit since it ""wasn't their fault"". Despite the fact that they received payment twice 3 months in a row for the same household. The manager apologized and said it was their policy. He also said that the customers need to be responsible. I explained that it was an oversight on our end but that they still were paid twice regardless. I would have been satisfied with 3 credits to our account. We have been customers for a number of years. Instead I canceled both accounts and won't utilize their service again.

First and foremost, the quality of every show/movie varies but almost all at some point will be reduced to 1980 VHS quality grainy visuals. That problem takes back burner when presented with the most glaring problem Netflix has - Disappearing movies/TV shows. I have multiple times watched a movie only to find it missing when I recommend it to a friend. These - off the top of my head- include Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Cowboy Bebop and various others. It's annoying to say the least when a service you pay for starts denying you exactly what is says it will deliver.

After receiving multiple scratched, unplayable discs in a row, I canceled my Netflix DVD service. Then, after trying to stream a movie on Netflix on different evenings with constant re-buffering, I canceled my streaming service as well.

With respect to the re-buffering, in particular, they blamed the issue on my equipment (which works perfectly with other streaming services) and my supposedly ""slow"" FiOS high speed connection (which streams HBO Go, Amazon and other streaming services with no issues).

I never had an experience of a DVD been lost in the mail or anything like that. The stream has crashed a couple of times since I've had it but no big deal.

I never really paid attention to the monthly charge for streaming; yet upon searching for an unrelated credit last night, I discovered the charge of $29.99. It should only be $7.99.

I reread the terms of service to see if I had missed an important caveat… to no avail. They state they will notify customers when a change in service fee happens; there is no change.

I have not had customer service problems with Netflix (so far) - they've always been okay. My issue is with their inefficient website. It breaks down or is incomplete, tells people they can't sign in, goes for weeks without publishing consumer reviews of the movies (very important for many of us who count on reviews before deciding on a film), won't let me access parts of my account, and various other glitches. I have honestly never seen a website this bad. As of this writing, the website has been ""down"" for two days, despite a notice that their engineers are ""working hard"" to restore it.

I put $20 on it, and voila, I used this card upon registration for the free trial that requested a credit card. I then used that money to order e-juice for my electric cigarette online to put my funds to good use.

When my credit card expired, my account was deactivated, so I reentered my information with the new expiration dated credit card. It turns out this opened up a new account and reactivated my old account, resulting in Netflix double charging my account every month until I noticed. The service I received was the bare minimum, and rather than illustrating that Netflix values their customer through refunding the double charges or providing months at no charge because they were already paid for, Netflix showed they do not care about their customer, but rather only for their money. So Netflix lost me as a customer, which is a shame, because it would have been no out of pocket to them. Just as well, I'd rather not contribute to their greedy mentality.",2012-11-02,1,0

I left them back in February, but I started watching again recently when my roommate got a membership. He let his friend use it as well. I got sick of having to wait to use it (heaven forbid you have more than two devices using it at the same time), so I finally got my own membership again. Much to my dismay, I just found out that they no longer offer my favorite show, “Roseanne.” I don't have cable. The only reason I get Netflix is to watch shows. “Roseanne” is all I watched the last time I had it and now that I have it again I can't even watch my damn show. I know they have to pay for licenses to stream the shows and movies, but when their selection is crap to begin with, I don't understand why they can't keep what they have and build on it rather than pick and choose and play the odds.",2012-07-29,1,0

I understand that movie ratings are a 'guide' for parents to use, and I realize that children can use the ""kids"" link to access appropriate content, but there are no mechanisms for parents to ""block"" content such as this from accidental access. Apple has a fairly strict process for preventing kids from accessing ""explicit content"", but Netflix does not and that is really surprising to me. I think you need to come up with a more family friendly process for using you services on computers, home entertainment systems, mobile devices etc., and enable specific blocking of content.

They still have a value plan with DVDs only, which they could have reclassified me as being on, and then notified me by a letter and a phone call. I get many emails from them. I'm the email contact, but I'm not the one in my household watching most of the movies, and I don't care to read Netflix emails, when the subject lines just about say it all.

That usually takes some doing! They took off streaming! They did this with lost! These are series where it’s necessary to watch every episode or a person could get lost!

It pissed me off when they split them up in the first pay instead of that low cost they offered in the beginning. I see this as a strong arm tactic to get me to pay for DVDs. Like I said I really do not have any use for ordering DVDs and with my lifestyle I cannot.

I was told that both services had been canceled, and I would no longer be charged. I noticed on my bank statement that, I had been charged $7.99 in November and in December. I called Netflix customer support, and was informed that after I had verbally called and canceled the service, someone had reactivated it by trying to watch a movie online.

By doing so, the representative erased the entire saved queue (over 40 movies). Even after a week, they were not able to get any saved movies back. We've been a customer with Netflix for years, so we are very disappointed that they only offered us a credit for $3. That is, 25% off the monthly fee - only 1 week for free. We are very disappointed! We expected at least one month for free! They have bad customer service!",2011-09-02,1,6

When a DVD is sent damaged, they offer a replacement DVD as a customary practice. Since the membership is charged monthly, sending an additional DVD does not eliminate the issue. Netflix continues to profit while customers simply get poor service. Only on a few occasions did a representative offer a partial discount.

I've been a customer long before anyone even knew what Netflix was and yet I am finally fed up. I think their price hike is a stupid business move and they'll upset enough people eventually to lose out on the great thing they had going. The only thing that is stopping me from canceling is the expensive Roku that I bought and installed a week before their rate hike was announced. Blahh! Netflix, you disappoint!",2011-08-23,3,7

This happened to be one day after my account was charged for the comming month. I cancelled through their website and never saw any notice that there would be no refund for unused service, which they claim when I called today was printed on the cancellation screen. Every other company that I have ever done business with, automatically calculates and issues a refund for any unused portion of service that was paid in advance.
