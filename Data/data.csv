This means I lost all my saved game data over the last 5 years.

He fixed the password issue, no problem. I happened to mention that all 3 sets of my son’s Joy-Cons were defective (drifting) and that he was unable to use them. Daniel explained that I could send them all in for repair FOR FREE or, if they couldn’t be fixed, they would most likely be replaced at no charge. I was elated! Within the hour, I received an email containing the shipping label for the Joy-Cons. We packed them up and shipped them out a few days after initially calling Nintendo.

The product feels solid, and works well but does have some issues. Mostly the controllers (at least on the first generation) seem to have wireless connection issues when obscured from line of site.

They simply said they do not allow returns and quoted something about Terms of Service. What kind of company cares SO LITTLE about customer service that they won't do something as simple as exchanging a digital download at no monetary loss to themselves? I don't have a lot of disposable income and was biting my nails about spending the money to begin with, so this was quite a blow to morale and a huge disappointment in the Nintendo company. I've always liked their games but I guess they really just don't give a flying fig about the people that support them and made them what they are today.",2018-03-21,1,2

I bought a Nintendo switch which I was completely dissatisfied with. For me it was a really bad choice. It came with NO games whatsoever - nothing and I had to sign up and put credit in an account to buy any games to even start it and see if I liked it. So I had to commit extra money before knowing if I liked it. Having signed up and put credit in the account in order to try it I decided it was not what I wanted so I asked for my remaining unused credit back - it is just sitting there, I haven't bought anything with it and I have been told by phone and email that I cannot have the credit back.

As a lifelong Nintendo customer I purchase a Nintendo Switch the day it comes out only to receive a system with a huge dead pixel in the center of the screen. I send this system for repair which takes two weeks. My next system will not connect with the Joy-Cons nor will it stay connected online. I send the second system for repair and receive a third system that starts to overheat and smoke while on a plane burning the system housing and was hot to the touch for the remainder of the flight. Customer service tries to get me to send the system in from another country and asks me to troubleshoot the system with its dock while I am at an airport. Two weeks later I send the system in and pester the company to send me a completely new system. Which they claimed they did.

I have a nightmare story that consists of issues that at no way are my fault or my family’s fault that lead to Nintendo dropping the ball and ignoring me for years. It all started when the Wii U came out. I already had a Wii, and about 500-750 in digital content I transferred over to my new Wii U. Did the transfer when it first became available. Transferred everything. Went fine. First day sold. I traded in my system in order to get a good special trade in offer value like extra 50% value if I used the credit on Wii U games in store credit so naturally I did it.

I mistakenly left a game cartridge in the system when I mailed it and didn't realize it until that evening. They explicitly told me to remove any game and other accessories so I figured the game would be gone. To my surprise, in the returned box, there was a plastic mailing bag taped to the inside of the top with my game cartridge in it.

Initially he wanted a Playstation, but because of his age, we steered him towards the smaller Nintendo DS system.

I have owned every major console Nintendo has put out, have always had perfect experiences and the consoles themselves have maintained playability and reliability for years, almost never having issues. Most are still useable today. However, this has changed with the WiiU. I've never had a more dissatisfactory experience with ANY electronic product I've ever bought. Ever. I bought my console brand new, it was not a refurbished console, nor was it one of the first released consoles that hadn't had its kinks worked out. I bought it several years after the initial launch of the WiiU, specifically because I was so wary after reading other reviews, which I know realize are correct. The console is a failure.

Last week it just would not turn on so as it was supposedly under warranty I again sent it in. Today I got an e-mail saying it was not a manufacturing defect, that it had ""spillage"". I know for a fact nothing and I mean nothing was ever spilled on it. My son took excellent care of the system. So once again I am on the hook for $100 repair. I am disgusted especially since Nintendo boasts the best warranty in the business. Really? Searching the internet I found so many incidents of ""the black screen of death"".

I got my Wii U last November because of the new Super Smash Bro. I had both Wii and GameCube before, but wasn't too into any of the Wii U games until Hyrule Warrior and Smash Bro. June of this this year (8 month after I got my Wii U), I couldn't turn on the Wii U console for some reason. There was no red light. Naturally, I send it to repair, and that's when my nightmare begins. By the way, the Wii U console was never touched. It stands on the middle shelf of the TV stand, and I have no pet. I haven't touch my Wii U console (nor do I have reason to) so I highly doubt that I did something to break it (and I live alone with no roommate so I'm 100% sure it died on its own). So I submitted a repair order to Nintendo, and the shipping was going to Purolator. I send it over on Wednesday, and I got a notice on Friday that the Nintendo received it.

I called the Nintendo repair phone number to complain - that was not the case. They claimed that the socket to plug into electrical outlet was loose which was affecting it being powered on, so it wasn't covered under warranty. They said my son must have been rough with unplugging the console. I told them that my son barely played with it and he has taken care not to handle it roughly.
