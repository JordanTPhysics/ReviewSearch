Scenario: ASUS offers three applications, MyASUS, Armoury Crate, and AI Suite 3 that provide driver & utility updates. All of which end up being older versions compared to their drivers posted to their website, and currently on my system. For example, RAID/ SATA driver on my system is dated 2021, after the update, the driver date was 2020.

Another issues that is under MYAsus/ Customer Service there are more than one driver and utility being offered under one particular category. As mentioned before, RAID/ SATA drivers. There were two listed. You have to review the version number, digit by digit to decipher whether it is new or older than the driver option underneath. Companies, including Intel, date their drivers and utilities. This practice is less time consuming for the End User.

Microsoft is another problem. When I perform a clean install of Windows 10/ 11, I install all my system drivers. Then, when Windows scans my system for updates, I get hit with drivers updates with ASUS signature attached. In turn, Microsoft is providing drivers that are newer than what ASUS is releasing. I noticed this particularly with the Intel graphics driver.

Communication: Lacking. They sent me a form. I immediately filled it out and sent it back to them. They indicated that they didn't receive it. I checked, the email was in my ""sent"" folder, and an electronic receipt was generated through MS Outlook verifying transmission was successful. Which means it hit their email server. Language barrier is also a problem. I do not enjoy having to decode their instructions due to their inability to speak the English language.

Contact Numbers: Numbers that are offered in the Manual (Dated 2021) are becoming obsolete. I tried a few and got absolutely no where. I had to google, ASUS Customer Support.

I come from a long history of only purchasing Intel boards. Unfortunately, they stopped manufacturing their motherboards in 2014. Not once did I have to call Intel on any issue upon installation. Their documentation was straightforward, and diagrams were large enough, that you didn't have to second guess.

Finally analysis: I experience better results googling my issues. Don't forget, there are others that are experiencing the same issue as yourself.",2022-02-01 09:10:00,neg

I have contacted customer service multiple times with little information.

When a charge was sent me for my repair, I had issues paying it and called to confirm if the payment was received. The customer service representative said ""oh yeah it's all good."" Cut to two weeks later, I get a call saying my repair has been delayed because of issue with payment.

Weeks later I call customer service again for a general update. The representative informs me my laptop has shipped and was delivered! I was happy but confused, I had never received a tracking number. It wasn't delivered. I asked the representative for the tracking number, and doublechecked for myself with them on the line. They had given me the tracking number for when I shipped the device TO Asus, all the way back in April. This representative practically made me do their job by checking the tracking number. Then they said they would escalate my case and I would be contacted in 48 business hours. Weeks pass I call again.
Still waiting for my laptop, that just needed the RAM replaced.

Also your phone survey never works. I have called 6+ times in the past 2 and half months. It's as if you don't want to hear how disorganized your operation is.
I will never send my laptop Asus for repairs again, and honestly you all should send me some free stuff because it should not be this difficult to fix a BRAND NEW LAPTOP.

I had multiple issues and had tried to fix myself. Fitroy solved all 5-6 concerns and was extremely diligent in fulfilling all my requests, when one method didn't work he found an alternative method and literally solved all the problems, from the fan being on high all the time, to reinstalling screenpadplus expert, fixing the lighting when not plugged into adapter, to connecting to my big screen TV which took some figuring out and even helping me be able to find the ASUS screen saver rainbow swirls. His patience, diligence and care are exemplary and ASUS can be completely confident in his abilites and customer care. I went from extremely worried and frustrated to delighted with my computer being restored to full capability in a very short time. Fitzroy also took extra time to make sure all of my issues were addressed and helped me to understand my brand new beautiful computer in a most helpful and proffessional manner. I appreciate his serving this company and brand in a truly remarkable fashion!",2021-04-09 18:31:00,pos

Because of the positive experience, we just bought a higher end VivoBook to do more demanding tasks. It is a nicely built laptop and everything works great except it would not work in video conference call. I called Asus technical help on Saturday for help. I was connected to Rushay S faily quickly. She walked me through all the checks including rebooting the motherboard. Everything checked out ok. I am going to use it in a conference call to see if it is resolved. I am happy with the technical service I received from Rushay S.",2021-02-08 14:33:00,pos
