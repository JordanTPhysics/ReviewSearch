Sometimes the app is not that great with suggesting shows that you may like. I also don’t like how many of the representation matters programs for ** people are centered around police violence. It’s very triggering to see that every time you watch a movie. I’ve noticed in many of Netflix programming that they like to add in these triggering scenes and it’s becoming quite predictable. Overall the app is good and is a good alternative to cable. We need more light hearted programming. Less focused on social themes just some funny shows to watch.,2021-09-18,4,24,0.29803921568627456,0.49607843137254903,"['enjoy', 'however', 'don ’', 'think', 'enough', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sometimes', 'app', 'great', 'suggest', 'show', 'may', 'like', 'also', 'don ’', 'like', 'many', 'representation', 'matter', 'program', 'people', 'center', 'around', 'police', 'violence', '’ s', 'trigger', 'see', 'every', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', '’ ve', 'notice', 'many', 'program', 'like', 'add', 'trigger', 'scene', '’ s', 'become', 'quite', 'predictable', 'overall', 'app', 'good', 'good', 'alternative', 'cable', 'need', 'light', 'hearted', 'program', 'less', 'focus', 'social', 'theme', 'funny', 'show', 'watch']","movie, show, watch, like, tv, great, s, series, love, would",15.0,0.2275222903293815

And this is embarrassing to admit but I also needed something playing to help me sleep, I only had Netflix so I used it next to all of the time. Because of all of that Netflix decided that I binge watched too much. They decided to ""punish me"" by automatically skipping over the ""recap"" of the previous episodes, even though I have always wanted to watch it.

I checked with my bank and they said Netflix ran a charge against my account for $20.15. The most I've ever paid for the Netflix service was $11.95. The banker I spoke with said that this was not uncommon for Netflix and that they had this issue frequently. They told me that the only thing I could do to avoid the charge going through was to call Netflix and tell them you needed them to do an ""Immediate manual reversal"". This is something that the banker told me they had done before.

It's obvious they have no knowledge about the app and zero will to help. When you ask for any alternatives, they tell you they will e-mail you the link to unsubscribe. Who does that?? I'm not sure if they underpay their representatives but nobody seems to care about helping with customer service. They are very nonchalant about it. It's a ""go ahead, we don't need you attitude"". Considering the competition out there, I'm not surprised people are switching to Hulu and Amazon. However, they don't care. Plus, they lack common sense. They don't train their customer service department in anything about the app that may help, they are clueless but the worst part is that they are extremely rude.

I thought I would give them a try since the email specifically said, ""Enjoy another free trial"" right on a button that linked to Netflix. They recognized my old account in in about 2 minutes I was up and running. Then I checked the billing area just to make sure it was free and it's then I determined I was being billed. I called Netflix and they said since I had once had a free trial, that I was no longer eligible. I told them the email said, ""Enjoy another free trial"" and they said read the fine print. Sure enough, the fine print said no additional free trials although in bold print the email sent to me which was from my previous registration said, ""Enjoy another free trial"".

Initially for DVDs and more recently for streaming, and adding roughly over $2000 to Netflix profitability, helping make them one of the big guys (FAANG). Well, NOT ANY LONGER. Netflix has become too big and proves once again how power corrupts. Netflix used to provide a very good and diverse service. They should have stayed with that model!

It offers a wide selection of tv shows and movies and the layout felt easier to use that others like Amazon Prime or Hulu. It always had something for me to watch and I could usually find the shows I loved on it. For a while, it was improving. More shows. Better shows. Shows from all over the world. More language options. More anime even, a guilty pleasure of mine. As of the past year, it's gone downhill though. They've upped the price while removing a lot of my favorite shows. What used to be the place where I could catch up on shows I loved and rewatch old favorites or binge new series, has become a place of frustration as they literally remove shows while I'm in the middle of watching them. And there isn't even a warning! Many shows like Switched at Birth, Being Human, and so many more have been removed.

Lastly I had several problems that took a lot a time to solve; one of my former account that I didn't use anymore had been hacked; I saw that 9.99 GBP had been removed from my bank account on February 8th and March 8th (normally I pay 9.99$CA every 20th of the month); though this amount has been refunded, I am really surprised that no one was even able to notify me unusual activities on this account. And the only way for me to secure this account was to change the e-mail address+password, to reactivate the account, and then to pay 9.99$ the subscription. Of course, I cancelled my subscription right away, but the 9.99$ that has been taken from my account still hasn't been refunded, though all of this happened on March 8th.

During this time her card was being charged for what she thought was the same account. After 22 months we realized we were both paying for the same service and called CS to cancel one form of payment. We were informed that her payment was not being applied to her active account but rather a fraudulent account in Honduras. Obviously we contacted the bank immediately to cancel the card. We asked that Netflix refund the charges for the bogus account but were told that their policy only allows for a two month refund despite the facts that they've been receiving payments for nearly 2 years. As a long time customer with several other active accounts, I expected a quick resolution ie: a refund for the fraudulent charges.

I am guessing Netflix raised their prices in the time it took me to subscribe as my $60 gift card wasn't expected to go as far as expected when I signed up. I used Netflix for about a month without an issue. I will be without internet for an indefinite period and I wanted to put my account on hold or cancel the subscription so I could use my balance when I started with Netflix again in the future. I was told by floor manager Michael in Tampa, FL, customer service that I could not save my $50 plus balance from being reduced to nothing during the time I will be without internet, even after I canceled my subscription.

We've endured price increase after price increase. We've been patient and understanding about half of our choices not being available on Netflix... they are on the DVD format... just not at Netflix... that's the first issue. However, what we are finding more and more often in the last year or two... which is much more frustrating... is that we now find ourselves waiting not just for weeks, but for MONTHS, for one disc in our queue. Mind you, this is something that is on DVD, that Netflix has, that they let us add to our queue... but one disc has been on 'very long wait' for three months now. This happens a lot!!!

I knew of the company prior to joining and how they started with renting DVDs which quickly put blockbuster out of business.

WARNING, Check your credit card information on Netflix ""Update your credit or debit card"" page!!! I tried to ""update"" my information today to a different credit card. At first, the site complained that the CVV number was invalid, which of course it was not. I tried 3 times, on the 3rd time, it seemed to take it without complaint. However, I noticed something very odd. As I had always entered my first, middle initial and last name, it had taken my initial and added that to my last name! I called support to let them know of this issue and to confirm if my card was accepted. Apparently the card was accepted. When I mentioned about the last name being wrong, the guy tried to convince me that this is just a typo and that it's ok. I informed him that I am a certified computer tech and work in Corporate Head Offices of a major bank and that this is NOT acceptable.

You get Short wait, long wait or very long wait for disc #1 of a DVD season. What their system wants to say is that customers always want to watch the first disc of a TV season before getting the second disc. So let's say that you have a 5 disc TV season in your queue. That's 5 individual discs. Netflix tags disc #1 as long wait and none of the discs for the season are shipped. But if you change the sequence in your queue from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 you will get 2 - 5 pretty much immediately and disc #1 is left hanging as ""long wait"". If you want to give Netflix the benefit of a great doubt, you will have to believe that Netflix carries 1 copy of disc 1 and 50 copies of disc 2.

Their Lack of new movies & shows (some takes up to 2 years or more after season is over to be available on Netflix.) I seen it on DVD and other sites before it reaches netflix. What is my biggest issues is the content that they're showing. A lot are no names that no one has heard of or Netflix made it. (**I have watched some I really liked & continued to watch) but my favorites are being removed mainly Fox shows that I noticed. I watch American Dad & Family Guy when I go to bed, guess what shows are supposed to be cancelled this year.

That is until you add up a year of paying for a service you thought you canceled. They make it so easy your two-year-old can hack into your account which is not really the proper word because hacking requires skill not the push of a button.

I understand Netflix is in debt but is it really fair to say you're bumping the price up so you can add more movies??

Remember, Netflix offers original movies and some of the most original series in the recent years. However, Netflix is only as good as your internet service. The question is often asked as to how good is the streaming of Netflix? Well, if you have poor internet service do not be surprised if you do not get the quality you might have expected when using Redbox or a DVD.

I tried updating and it would not accept it. I contacted customer service again. They said something was wrong with my card - I knew nothing was wrong because there was plenty of funds there.

I was able to use the service as time permitted with no issues. Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether. The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card... I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.

Some of the movies that Amazon has I don't know where they came from the horrible. They have movies that I already saw. So my outcome is neither one are good.

Extremely unprofessional, lacking in their ability to listen to the customer because they are regurgitating the script to which they are told to adhere. Simple problems seem to befuddle them. I had a DVD plan which I wanted to switch to the streaming plan. I tried doing this 4+ times and it did not work. I called to get help. A kid named Dylan took the call. I explained the situation to him. He didn't listen to the fact that I had gone through all the steps necessary to change plans. He took me through them again, twice. As I was switching my phone to speaker so that I could type, he said ""Hey, If you're not going to ** talk to me I'm going to ** hand up on your **."" I said, ""Excuse me?"" Then he started denying that he had spoken to me in that way. I always record customer service calls so that in case a call is dropped, I can call back and ask for the same person.

Then when I notice two charges on my bank account I called Netflix Customer Service for the second time (to be honest I was ready to cancel my monthly subscription). But after speaking with the customer service rep. and him going the extra mile by going beyond what I needed or expected he change my mind and kept me as a customer.

It's the most ridiculous system I have ever heard. I had about $400 in my account when I updated my information on Netflix, why should I have to update my card information twice when it's the same card!!!

It offered new and refreshing shows and movies that were not readily available online or on cable channels with HD quality such as Jane the Virgin, Jessica Jones, How to Get Away with Murder, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Daredevil, etc. It was entertaining following such shows and I liked that Netflix recommended movies and shows based on my viewing preferences. That introduced me to similar shows that were worth checking out. Another good point is Netflix allows various users to create their own account and chose and save the shows they like.

This time they never sent me any email but shut off my account. When I called, Marcus told me that he needed the last 8 digits of my old VISA card. Anyone who's ever gotten a new card knows that you destroy the old card when you get a new one. The new card (obviously) had a new card number and expiration date.

Approx. 3 wks ago my Netflix came due and since I was running low on money in my bank acct I decided to buy a $20 gift card so I wouldn't chance over drafting because we think my bank acct was hacked. Called in the card and they took it over the phone. Several hrs later still no Netflix. Called them up again and they finally turned it on. Several days later that week it was turned off again for payment. I called them up and they tell me they didn't know how to make the card apply to my acct, but somehow they turned it on again. The same thing happened a week later. Then again this week. So when I asked to speak to the supervisor, Kerry put on Calvin. Calvin proceeds to tell me that they need to charge my bank account in order to apply the $20 card I purchased.

Based upon the explanation that I was given I agreed to a refund of 3 months, however I had discovered that I hadn't used the streaming account since 9 months ago! But, the DVD plan sent DVD's to me that I had returned except for K-Pax and another DVD that I can't remember the name of right now. The last DVD that was sent to me was sent 4 months ago. It was an automated process by the way.

Sometimes it takes up to 45 minutes to load Netflix.

I explained we are in the tech industry and have done all appropriate troubleshooting and still having issues and he basically said he could email me instructions for troubleshooting (didn't we just cover that??) and refused to hear that there might actually be an issue on Netflix's end. He went on to said Netflix was a bandwidth hog, then he proceeded to laugh and reiterate that he would send me instructions for troubleshooting (really, is a third time necessary??). I went on to try and explain I was hoping to get a credit on our account for the inconvenience and he proceeded in giving me two options, cancel my subscription or use the troubleshooting instructions.

I am paying for 2 blu-ray discs at a time. My account has two profiles, myself and my husband's. Apparently, only the primary account holder's profile (me) can get blu-rays; the other profile can only get regular DVD's. I called the Netflix help center and the tech I talked to was no help at all. He couldn't understand why I would want two profiles anyway. I explained that my husband and I have different tastes in movies so the profiles are configured for the types of movies we each want to see. He also showed that I was charged for the next month on my credit card even though my free trial doesn't end until June 17, 2015. He said he removed the charge so I can cancel my membership and rejoin to see if that makes any difference. Also, I asked where I can send my complaints and he said only the Help Desk (him) can enter complaints.",2015-06-14,4,7,0.190625,0.6329326923076923,"['able', 'figure', 'problem', 'bluray', 'problem', 'guy', 'help', 'disk', 'nt', 'clue', 'anything', 'think', 'company', 'need', 'well', 'train', 'people', 'still', 'nt', 'understand', 'bill', 'still', 'freetrial', 'period', 'll', 'watch', 'statement', 'closely', 'far', 'nt', 'problem', 'others', 'mention', 'original', 'review', 'june', 'pay', 'bluray', 'disc', 'time', 'account', 'two', 'profile', 'husband', 's', 'apparently', 'primary', 'account', 'holder', 's', 'profile', 'blurays', 'profile', 'regular', 'dvd', 's', 'call', 'help', 'center', 'tech', 'talk', 'help', 'could', 'nt', 'understand', 'would', 'want', 'two', 'profile', 'anyway', 'explain', 'husband', 'different', 'taste', 'movie', 'profile', 'configure', 'type', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'also', 'show', 'charge', 'next', 'month', 'creditcard', 'eventhough', 'freetrial', 'nt', 'end', 'june', 'say', 'remove', 'charge', 'cancel', 'membership', 'rejoin', 'see', 'make', 'difference', 'also', 'ask', 'send', 'complaint', 'say', 'help', 'desk', 'enter', 'complaint']","account, service, charge, customer, call, never, s, review, would, could",0.0,0.04828923510613005

I call customer service to be chided by the manager for my not noticing sooner that Netflix was over billing me.

He didn't know why and said this must be something new they are doing. Usually you got a discount for buying a year in advance, which ran under $100.

First and foremost, the quality of every show/movie varies but almost all at some point will be reduced to 1980 VHS quality grainy visuals. That problem takes back burner when presented with the most glaring problem Netflix has - Disappearing movies/TV shows. I have multiple times watched a movie only to find it missing when I recommend it to a friend. These - off the top of my head- include Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Cowboy Bebop and various others. It's annoying to say the least when a service you pay for starts denying you exactly what is says it will deliver.

The ISPs are not throttling the speed. Netflix Content Delivery Network Servers cannot handle the demand. Netflix seems to want it all without the expense of building their own CDNS (Content Delivery Network Servers). Instead Netflix should be building far more regionally located Netflix CDN Servers to meet their customer demand and not relying on the ISPs to shoulder the load. While they call it Open Connect, Netflix is actually closing off access to some of its content while seeking unprecedented preferential treatment from ISPs.

I ended up having a lot of free time after work and weekends, due to putting myself on a strong no spending, cut debt program. So Netflix served as great entertainment for those days spent at home.

Beside the fact that they are not a good company, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ANY KIND, and a constantly changing programs menu, and offer all too little in streaming programming, the bottom line here is this...THE SERVICE IS TOTAL GARBAGE!!!

God only knows how long I had been paying for two accounts. That states volumes for online credit card statements. Having four credit cards, I wasn't smart enough to realize that I was paying twice each month since the statements come in on the beginning and last week of each month. What can one do? I noticed that I am not alone in this double billing of multiple accounts thing. They must love fools such as me.

So I clicked on the plan to ship and decided to click on cancel instant view right away so I would not be charge for both but it did not work. So I called customer service the next day. After explaining customer service for 30 minutes what I wanted, she did not want to help. In fact, she helped me leaning towards cancelling shipping service as well. I wanted to give Netflix another chance but the lady on the other line (Netflix) helped make my decision. She even offered me to write a letter happily.

Original review: Jan. 5, 2013
I have not had customer service problems with Netflix (so far) - they've always been okay. My issue is with their inefficient website. It breaks down or is incomplete, tells people they can't sign in, goes for weeks without publishing consumer reviews of the movies (very important for many of us who count on reviews before deciding on a film), won't let me access parts of my account, and various other glitches. I have honestly never seen a website this bad. As of this writing, the website has been ""down"" for two days, despite a notice that their engineers are ""working hard"" to restore it. Personally, I think they need to tell their webmaster(s) that it's time to move on then hire people who can design and maintain a website properly!",2018-01-14,4,4,0.05062169312169312,0.5088624338624338,"['s', 'website', 'massively', 'improve', 'last', 'year', 'easy', 'navigate', 'nolonger', 'delay', 'everything', 'account', 'accessible', 'look', 'like', 'take', 'advice', 'hire', 'someone', 'fix', 'website', 'problem', 'long', 'time', 'thanks', 'original', 'review', 'jan', 'customer', 'service', 'problem', 'far', 've', 'always', 'okay', 'issue', 'inefficient', 'website', 'break', 'incomplete', 'tell', 'people', 'cant', 'sign', 'go', 'week', 'without', 'publishing', 'consumer', 'review', 'movie', 'important', 'many', 'u', 'count', 'review', 'decide', 'film', 'wont', 'let', 'access', 'part', 'account', 'various', 'glitch', 'honestly', 'never', 'see', 'website', 'bad', 'write', 'website', 'two', 'day', 'despite', 'notice', 'engineer', 'work', 'hard', 'restore', 'personally', 'think', 'need', 'tell', 'webmaster', 's', 'time', 'move', 'hire', 'people', 'design', 'maintain', 'website', 'properly']","account, service, charge, customer, call, never, s, review, would, could",0.0,0.04828923510613005

Christina was sarcastic and was mocking me with that little laughter thing that customer service reps do when they want to make fun of their customers. I phoned them and Hulu on March 15, 2012 to change my billing date. Hulu was very accommodating, even though I could have completed my request on their website. The rep was considerate enough to walk me through the process, with clarity and excellent customer service. On the other hand, I got nothing but bad attitude from the Netflix rep. Before calling them, I checked their website and logged into my account to ascertain if their site was user-friendly for making the changes to my account. It was not.

In the last few years, Netflix has really gone downhill from being an industry leader and innovator to a joke of marketing incompetence. I've been a member since 2002 and have been very satisfied for most of that time, even choosing to remain patient and loyal during the whole ""Qwikster"" debacle. But in recent months, three changes I've noticed are really making it hard for me to remain a customer: (1) Fewer and fewer streaming options, despite them gearing the website to make it more difficult to add DVDs; (2) more ""long wait"" delays for many DVDs (for instance, my entire Christmas queue is flagged. That never used to happen, even during seasonal periods of high demand); and (3) longer turnaround times to receive DVDs by mail.

My first experience with Netflix was positive. They had DVD rentals which I used extensively. Also offered was streaming which I recently signed up for on a free trial and saw the price to be $8 after expiration of trial without DVDs. The first thing I had to do was download a proprietary Microsoft Silverlight, which is a memory hog and simply freezes up the dual processor laptop. Fast hard drive, high power multimedia processor and an expensive internet cable connection. Before I got to the failed Silverlight delivery, I noticed an anemic interface with virtually nothing there that I wanted to view. I selected a movie that I'd seen before and after an hour of several failed attempts, the movie loaded.

Thanks to what's been going on for the past 6 months or more, my enthusiasm has completely vanished and turned to anger. I can no longer get the new releases at the top of my list - for many, many months. Netflix skips over my priorities with a seeming arrogance and purposefulness. Phoning in to complain is useless. Most of those answering know little and seem to have been hired to placate. The supervisors are simply those who placate the best while failing to serve. Writing to corporate headquarters is the worst. They don't reply. I certainly hope others enter this market and become what Netflix used to be.

It might have nothing to do with this, but watching those shows was the only time I could relax. And I think that is what Netflix is supposed to do. It is supposed to entertain people.

As for picture quality, If you don't have a good ISP, maybe you're better off waiting or switching to a provider who offers better bandwidth. I personally stream Netflix on my TV but sometimes I log in with my laptop and I have no issues, even when I'm streaming wireless. As for the movies/shows, I am certain you can always find something that will suit you. Try being a bit more open. Browse through their huge collection and keep track of what you watch and add it up at the end of the month. See what it would of cost you if you went elsewhere. Just weigh the pros and cons for their service. Do you really think your losing out for $7.99?",2012-02-07,3,0,0.30095238095238097,0.43809523809523815,"['happen', 'come', 'across', 'site', 'surf', 'net', 'decide', 'browse', 'comment', 'gather', 'cant', 'satisfy', 'everyone', 'several', 'friend', 'subscribe', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'subscriber', 'aswell', 'enjoy', 'every', 'bit', 'apologize', 'offend', 'anyone', 'expect', 'popcorn', 'picture', 'quality', 'nt', 'good', 'isp', 'maybe', 're', 'well', 'wait', 'switch', 'provider', 'offer', 'well', 'bandwidth', 'personally', 'stream', 'tv', 'sometimes', 'log', 'laptop', 'issue', 'even', 'm', 'stream', 'wireless', 'moviesshows', 'certain', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'suit', 'try', 'bit', 'open', 'browse', 'huge', 'collection', 'keep', 'track', 'watch', 'add', 'end', 'month', 'see', 'would', 'cost', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'weigh', 'pro', 'con', 'service', 'really', 'think', 'lose']","movie, stream, watch, service, also, time, program, show, tv, family",8.0,0.21588517451652559

I called Netflix when I found this and the operator stated that he could clearly see that I had not signed up twice and I would be credited all my money back to my credit card on the account created in July! However, this did not happen, I was only credited for three months of the six months I was billed. I called and asked Netflix why I couldn't have the rest and was told their system would not let them refund that to me. Then I asked if they could give me a free month because they could clearly see it was a fraud account.

I got their notice on My Netflix to update my credit card information because my card was expiring soon. This led to a call to the credit card company as to why they hadn't sent me a new card. They had, two months earlier, but I never received it. The solution was that they'd send me a new card with a new number for security reasons within ten days. They would not give me the new credit card number over the phone. The day before I received my new credit card, and not wanting to use a different card for Netflix, I started streaming a Netflix movie. It cut out with no warning mid-movie. I called Netflix and they said that they needed my new credit card information immediately or all service would stop this minute, even though I was prepaid for another week. The Netflix representative was rude and not at all helpful (company policy and I should read the fine print).

I upgraded to blu-ray service and have maintained it even moving up to two at a time. Lately, the movies have been unavailable or not available at Neflix when Redbox and Blockbuster express have them in stock so I rent the movies from them. I did keep my account when they had the price change. I saw on the Internet that Neflix will be spinning off the mail order DVD rentals so I decided to change my plan for the following month to only streaming but maintain the current blu-ray subscription for September. They then shipped me a standard DVD that was in my cue as blu-ray.

They have the opportunity for people to give Netflix as gifts and when the gift membership is completed they dont provide an option, They just start charging the card that has been put in the system after the free membership. There is no option. I personally never used the service during the gift time or afterwards and have subsuqently been charged for quite a while. They in my opinion are charging a fraudulent service and need to provide the appropriate retribution to customers otherwise they are scamming the consumers.",2011-07-12,1,4,0.15000000000000002,0.45,"['complaint', 'opportunity', 'people', 'give', 'gift', 'gift', 'membership', 'complete', 'dont', 'provide', 'option', 'start', 'charge', 'card', 'put', 'system', 'free', 'membership', 'option', 'personally', 'never', 'use', 'service', 'gift', 'time', 'afterwards', 'subsuqently', 'charge', 'quite', 'opinion', 'charge', 'fraudulent', 'service', 'need', 'provide', 'appropriate', 'retribution', 'customer', 'otherwise', 'scamming', 'consumer']","account, service, time, card, month, s, charge, use, customer, cancel",2.0,0.06866929326411424
