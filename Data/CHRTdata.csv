We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would heartily recommend it. It’s particularly wonderful when you’re looking for something interesting and fun to do with dogs whilst in Canterbury.
I included some of the tour in our YouTube vlog if anyone is interested😆🙂: https://youtu.be/heZc2EY161U"

23,CHRT,2020-09-03 02:22:31.041005,This is a 45-minute historical walk along the river. The trip was pleasant and we enjoyed the peace and quiet to the fullest!
24,CHRT,2020-09-03 02:22:31.041005,"Sadly, we turned up for our tour at 12pm today and nobody greeted us. We had no emails or phone calls cancelling our trip. We waited alongside another family who had been waiting for 30 mins for their tour at 11:35am. The phone wasn’t answered and we got a different mobile number off the other family waiting. We traveled down from Essex for this… More"
25,CHRT,2020-09-03 02:22:31.041005,Please do not book with this company. Had a tour booked today and no-one turned up with no communication whatsoever. Waited outside for 30 mins with our Nan who is nearly 75. Finally got through to the manager (another family who had also been let down gave us her number) - no explanation given as to why it didn’t happen apart from ‘the boys must have forgotten to contact you to cancel.’
26,CHRT,2020-09-03 02:22:31.041005,Highlight of our day in Canterbury. Our guide (Pete) was both knowledgeable and funny and we all enjoyed the peace of being rowed up and down the river. Thank you!

28,CHRT,2019-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"Had an amazing time today with my mum and dad ,
They were visiting from Ireland ,
Oliver was an excellent tour guide.
Very knowledgable and also made the time in boat enjoyable and interesting,
Was a great experience and whilst it’s only 45 mins on the river it’s excellent to see the history and the job these guys do is amazing.
Also the young lad taking the payment (think was called auto) very pleasant and excellent customer service.
Definitely recommend to anyone"
29,CHRT,2019-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"Captain Dan gave a lively and interesting insight into the local history of the river, that you would not normally see without taking to the water."

34,CHRT,2019-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"Friendly, informal and informative little tour along parts of Canterbury we don't normally see."
35,CHRT,2019-09-04 02:22:31.041005,an alternative way to discover some of Canterbury's otherwise hidden little corners. Which just might be the most interesting ones... 🤭
36,CHRT,2019-09-04 02:22:31.041005,Sun was out and perfect our little boat trip! Met with a very warm welcome and thank you Jordan( hope names right!) for a very informative time.

41,CHRT,2018-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"Well, that was fun!
We had a great river trip today, made even better by four very funny American tourists who were making the most of an autumnal Canterbury tour with some take away wine (!).
Hope to visit again soon - and perhaps with a fuller historical story - the absence of full-on commentary was not the fault of our guide - but we definitely had quite a few raucous passengers!"
42,CHRT,2018-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"We had a great time on the tour with Captain Matt, he made it very informative and fun. My 8 year old daughter absolutely loved it. Thanks very much!"
43,CHRT,2018-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"had a fantastic trip on the Stour yesterday, with the amazing Matthew Emanuele. very funny, but very knowledgeable. slightly strange that a Canadian was teaching us English history, but seriously, if you can get on his boat, you won't be disappointed!!!
5* to Matt and the team!"
44,CHRT,2018-09-04 02:22:31.041005,"We had a wonderful tour: not only because of the beauty of the river, but also and foremost because of the great storytelling (and humour) of captain Matthew! We promised him to say that he is the best ��! A tour you must do when in Canterbury!"
45,CHRT,2018-09-04 02:22:31.041005,Had an absolutely wonderful time with Captain Jordan! He made the whole experience really fun for our whole group :) would definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Canterbury

64,CHRT,2017-09-04 02:22:31.041005,It was a great experience. You could pay the trip afterwards. Unfortunately I did not bring enough cash and could not pay by pin pass. They trusted me to go to the ATM to get some cash and come back to pay. This is something in The Netherlands you could not believe how trust worthy. Thank you. I paid my dead afterwards. Our Captain was Captain Canada he did a great job. ��
65,CHRT,2017-09-04 02:22:31.041005,I wasn't sure what to expect when my friend and I decided to go on the boat tour but this definitely exceeded my expectations and I couldn't have thought of a more relaxing way to spend an hour in the sunshine.… More
