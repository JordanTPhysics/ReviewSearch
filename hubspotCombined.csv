I have used Outlook for many years and it works well. The integration with HubSpot is very good.,5 of 5,Dec 8 2021

Je connais et j'utilise Outlook depuis très longtemps. Je tiens à garder ce programme.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Works well though prefer gsuit overall because integrates better. But I use outlook for all of my emails and it seems to work fine and I like the HubSpot tab. I like being able to track emails and also use templates for all of my various emails related to my customers.,4 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

Our company want the mails to track automatically without manually clicking on the subsport extension all the time. I am really suprised you havnt fix or prioritized this earlier there must have been other customers pointing out this issue.,1 of 5,Dec 6 2021

Nada do que eu pretendia fazer com a integração está funcionando. E principalmente a parte de criar link automático de reunião agendada me causa um grande transtorno.,2 of 5,Dec 2 2021

Encuentro muy útil la integración sin embargo no es tan amigable ni intuitiva. Hay correos que no ha monitoreo a pesar de activar esa opción. Los correos que envió desde marketing los veo solo en HubSpot no en Outlook cosa que es necesaria puesto que quiero trabajar con esos correos desde Outlook.,3 of 5,Dec 2 2021

really good as it is easy of use. i dont see me using out mail systems for daily use,4 of 5,Dec 2 2021

There seems to be a lot of functionality with both Gmail and Outlook 365 but very little to none with Outlook Exchange which seems to still be in the beta version and with so many different workarounds involved to get the most basic of functionality,3 of 5,Dec 1 2021

I recently connected my outlook to HubSpot however; nothing is tracking. No conversation history no email logs etc. Its essentially useless at this time,1 of 5,Dec 1 2021

The Outlook side panel in HubSpot has limited functionality especially when compared with the similar function for the Salesforce side panel. You are not able to directly attach emails to a contact record or associate with an opportunity or other related item.,2 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook works well for me enabling my thre edifferent work emails to be shown in one program,5 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Really wish Outlook had a way for Teams to connect with HubSpot meetings easily so that I could create meetings in HubSpot and have it sent to the right people and with a team meeting link automatically created. Gmail is so much better with HubSpot but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.,1 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

It was slightly unclear at first but I eventually saw that it would always stay active whenever opening Outlook which is better than having to always sign in when emails were through Gmail.,4 of 5,Nov 15 2021

Outlook is no problem,3 of 5,Nov 15 2021

isn't stable crashes serveral time a day/ is asking always (30 sec) for login because it does not safe the credentials it isn't possible to uncheck contact bar => which makes outlook also crashing,1 of 5,Nov 15 2021

It works decently well. My main issue is when creating an email it loads for a while and I have to sit and wait on the spinning ring to stop. Wish it worked more seamlessly.,2 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

After the installation you are pretty much ready to go. There's still a lot of features I don't use and default settings I had to change but in general it help the overall sales process.,4 of 5,Nov 12 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

Working excellent. Outlook is a great email communication tool for the business.,4 of 5,Oct 7 2021

Outlook is great and our main form of communication. Just could not get it to connect properly to HubSpot and didn't feel like we could get proper support at HubSpot to correct the problem. Super bummed.,1 of 5,Oct 7 2021

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

bien bien bien bien bien me parece biennnnnnnnnnn.................................................,4 of 5,Nov 15 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In.

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In.

A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

Outlook works well but the link between Outlook and HubSpot is not always consistent and causes Outlook to crash.,1 of 5,Nov 11 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot.

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s.

A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

Outlook works well but the link between Outlook and HubSpot is not always consistent and causes Outlook to crash.,1 of 5,Nov 11 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

Outlook very good and very useful for office work and for invite meetings and seeing mails,3 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In.

Gmail is so much better with HubSpot but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.,1 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

Experiência fantástica de uso. Rastreamento de email link para reuniões modelos e snippets disponíveis dentro do outlook,5 of 5,Aug 30 2021

Love being able to integrate the 2 programs - but the add on has made my outlook act very funky  slow and unusable at times ... when switching from calendar to email views- the screen will lag and not be completely viewabl e,1 of 5,Aug 30 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook. The add-in is very comfortable to use but my desktop Outlook keeps shutting it down as it constantly crashes it.. Also - it's very annoying that you have to log in every time and it doesn't remember you.,2 of 5,Aug 29 2021

The Outlook integration is great when it works correctly. often I have to "pop-out" my email to make the HubSpot functions available otherwise they're grayed out. Also can lock up Outlook for several minutes at a time.,3 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Leider vergisst das Add-On immer die Zugangsdaten. Das Add-On ist damit einfach nicht sinnvoll nutzbar. In der Hilfe sind dazu keine sinnvollen Informationen zu finden. Die Internet-Optionen in der Art und Weise zu öffnen ist leider keine Option.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

HubSpot keeps freezing and crashing in Outlook causing me to have to disable it or not keep it running meaning I have to try and remember to log emails as and when necessary.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

We have swapped to G Suite and now all working well. We were using Office 365 that we had purchased through GoDaddy - this prevented the integration from working properly.,2 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Unable to use it the way I would like to use the add on. Would like to see a window into HubSpot about that contact and not just use it for logging considering I can't manage my communications in HubSpot.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

My original HubSpot account via Gmail has been connected to my Outlook account. I would like to separate both as they are 2 separate businesses. HubSpot would not allow hence my Outlook integration feels almost inactive compared to my experience with my Gmail integration.,3 of 5,Aug 24 2021

Je connais et j'utilise Outlook depuis très longtemps. Je tiens à garder ce programme.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Works well though prefer gsuit overall because integrates better. But I use outlook for all of my emails and it seems to work fine and I like the HubSpot tab. I like being able to track emails and also use templates for all of my various emails related to my customers.,4 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

There seems to be a lot of functionality with both Gmail and Outlook 365 but very little to none with Outlook Exchange which seems to still be in the beta version and with so many different workarounds involved to get the most basic of functionality,3 of 5,Dec 1 2021

I recently connected my outlook to HubSpot however; nothing is tracking. No conversation history no email logs etc. Its essentially useless at this time,1 of 5,Dec 1 2021

Really wish Outlook had a way for Teams to connect with HubSpot meetings easily so that I could create meetings in HubSpot and have it sent to the right people and with a team meeting link automatically created. Gmail is so much better with HubSpot but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.,1 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

bien bien bien bien bien me parece biennnnnnnnnnn.................................................,4 of 5,Nov 15 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

After the installation you are pretty much ready to go. There's still a lot of features I don't use and default settings I had to change but in general it help the overall sales process.,4 of 5,Nov 12 2021

Absolutely love this integration. It saves so much time and helps keep things organized. Suggestions: - track emails that were sent as BCC. - the ability to 'untrack' a certain email after it was sent with tracking on.,4 of 5,Nov 10 2021

The function is not as efficient as it could be. It would be nice if it was possible to exclude emails from specific senders or with specific subjects. Too many unnecessary tickets are created from unimportant emails.,3 of 5,Nov 10 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

I wouldn't use the plugin. Use BCC if you can remember. The plugin slows Outlook to a crawl regardless of what you're trying to to (email / calendar).,1 of 5,Sep 17 2021

very difficult to work with. Confusing to set up. No documentation or phone support.,2 of 5,Sep 16 2021

We should have access to tutorials to understand and implement all functionalities.,5 of 5,Sep 16 2021

Outlook is alright but Id still prefer gmail over it. Outlook doesnt allow you to search comms easily unless the person has replied to you. Whereas in gmail you can pull up conversations seamlessly without any requirements.,2 of 5,Sep 15 2021

bem mas a sincronização e o acoplamento são ruins precisa melhorar inclusive na forma de fazer o acomplamento é pouco intuitivo,3 of 5,Sep 15 2021

I love the fact that it offers everything we need! From syncing with our other software applications our customer's calendars. my personal calendar. In addition to I'm a HUGE fan of Microsoft Teams!,5 of 5,Sep 14 2021

It's not working. It states that it is working but not with all the contacts and not with everyone.,2 of 5,Sep 14 2021

Outlook is very important for communication with clients and sharing pertinent information internally.,5 of 5,Sep 13 2021

Works well. Very good Idea beats Salesforce. I like the ease of it but have not worked long enough with the programm to give a final feedback about it.,4 of 5,Sep 13 2021

Outlook is working well for my regular communications. However I can see the benefits of using HubSpot and I do realize that it will time to become familiar and comfortable using HubSpot.,4 of 5,Sep 12 2021

Algunas veces tiene problemas. Se podría mejorar la aplicación incorporando algunos elementos de compatibilidad,5 of 5,Sep 11 2021

I love using Outlook. It is so easy to use and the integration between HubSpot and Outlook is so easy! It literally keeps track of all the emails I am sending to my customers so that I do not have to jump between the two systems. I can go to HubSpot and see every interaction with a particular customer without needing to search for them constantly in Outlook.,5 of 5,Sep 9 2021

die Integration funktioniert nicht bzw.hat ein Eigenleben wlches der Support nicht lösen kann,1 of 5,Sep 9 2021

I love the fact that i can track emails and know if they've been opened but.... the integration of HubSpot into Outlook sucks and Outlook crashes if not every day certainly every second day because of that integration.,3 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Works very well compared to our previous CRM Microsoft Dynamics. I think there are a few functionalities (as stated above) that could be improved but love the ability to track emails and to create deals and tasks directly from the email.,4 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either. My phone now is the only place that I can see all of my calendars and contacts in one place for example. So thumbs way down.,2 of 5,Sep 7 2021

Simple...just remember to use it on all communications. If you don't it might not sync up.,4 of 5,Sep 4 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Outlook funktioniert gut aber die Verbindung mit HubSpot nicht wirklich. Die Benutzerfreundlichkeit lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig.,1 of 5,Sep 3 2021

L'intégration ne fonctionne pas dans Environnement Mac Os et l'on retrouve pas la snippet dans Outlook,2 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The HubSpot integration allows me to see when my receivers open my emails which helps me follow up effectively.,5 of 5,Sep 1 2021

Lo dicho una funcionalidad mediocre e incómoda. No quiero trabajar con Outlook ya que el CRM tiene la gestión de correos SOLO querría el CRM y olvidarme de Outlook. Pero no puedo hacerlo porque los nuevos correos de contactos existentes no me llegan. Una decepción.,2 of 5,Sep 1 2021

Experiência fantástica de uso. Rastreamento de email link para reuniões modelos e snippets disponíveis dentro do outlook,5 of 5,Aug 30 2021

Love being able to integrate the 2 programs - but the add on has made my outlook act very funky  slow and unusable at times ... when switching from calendar to email views- the screen will lag and not be completely viewabl e,1 of 5,Aug 30 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook. The add-in is very comfortable to use but my desktop Outlook keeps shutting it down as it constantly crashes it.. Also - it's very annoying that you have to log in every time and it doesn't remember you.,2 of 5,Aug 29 2021

The Outlook integration is great when it works correctly. often I have to "pop-out" my email to make the HubSpot functions available otherwise they're grayed out. Also can lock up Outlook for several minutes at a time.,3 of 5,Aug 27 2021

HubSpot keeps freezing and crashing in Outlook causing me to have to disable it or not keep it running meaning I have to try and remember to log emails as and when necessary.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

We have swapped to G Suite and now all working well. We were using Office 365 that we had purchased through GoDaddy - this prevented the integration from working properly.,2 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Unable to use it the way I would like to use the add on. Would like to see a window into HubSpot about that contact and not just use it for logging considering I can't manage my communications in HubSpot.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing.

Ottima connessione ma l'esperienza su Gmail è decisamente migliore. I comandi sono più comodi più visibili etc.,4 of 5,Oct 14 2021

The way this captures sales and marketing activity is fantastic. I wish it were a little more transparent about the activities it excludes; I'm never trusting that it's not capturing emails that are excluded from tracking in HS or when I remove the tracking tags.,4 of 5,Oct 14 2021

I could not connect the two which of course lead to me not using it at all.,1 of 5,Oct 14 2021

Outlook is niet mijn favoriete tool maar ik gebruik het omdat het goed met HubSpot zou samenwerken,2 of 5,Oct 13 2021

the add-in is not that bad but big issues: 1. you can't track emails that have been already sent 2. when you write an email containing bulletpoint lists and then you track it the bulletpoints disappear and have to add them again,3 of 5,Oct 13 2021

The Outlook application keeps crashing on the local PC after the HubSpot connector has been installed.,1 of 5,Oct 12 2021

The integration is great but the fact that you don't really have a 2 way sync is very disappointing. Salesforce and every other CRM has a two way sync that matches the email address and automatically tracks the conversation instead of using a BCC which is tedious and makes it hard to keep unwanted contacts out of the CRM.,2 of 5,Oct 11 2021

Outlook is great and our main form of communication. Just could not get it to connect properly to HubSpot and didn't feel like we could get proper support at HubSpot to correct the problem. Super bummed.,1 of 5,Oct 7 2021

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

I'm going to be discontinuing using it as I have had clients who previously had no trouble receiving emails start having my emails go to their junk folder.,3 of 5,Oct 3 2021

Without Outlook we'd not be able to function. The plugin with HubSpot is honestly a bit wonky though. It's forced through Microsoft365 so that it's always there. It's stalled quite a few users though and we need to ensure that the plugin operates all the time.,3 of 5,Sep 24 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s.

Outlook me parece una herramienta muy útil de fácil uso para enviar y recibir correo,3 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

the add in always drops out and i have to re-upload it. the emails never link to the right accounts so i end up with 30 different wrong contacts on one account and it is a ball ache to try and correct. also if you don't correct this error these email will forever go to the wrong profile,1 of 5,Nov 2 2021

It's easy to sync the outlook and HubSpot emails with the connection. Sometimes mail are sent from HubSpot and sometimes from outlook depending on situation. With the systems synced I can see history from both places with ease.,4 of 5,Oct 29 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

It's just a tool - but a necessary tool... When dealing with customers who also have Outlook it's important to match them,3 of 5,Oct 28 2021

Outlook is fine but when I tried to send an email through HubSpot's Outlook integration to keep track of the emails regarding a support ticket two of the recipients I specified in the HubSpot mail client were missed out of the generated email and I did not realise until 3 days later when one of them emailed me asking for an update.,1 of 5,Oct 22 2021

Outlook werkt voor ons goed. Echter willen we zoveel mogelijk in HubSpot doen. Dit kan alleen niet omdat HubSpot teveel beperkingen heeft in het koppelen. Voornamelijk de agendafunctie ontbreekt volledig in HubSpot.,1 of 5,Oct 21 2021

Outlook is great it does what it is supposed to do. The HubSpot add-on slows Outlook down to a crawl. Outlook disables HubSpot all the time due to poor performance.,1 of 5,Oct 21 2021

Still in the trial phases at the moment but seems to be everything we could ever want from a CRM.,3 of 5,Oct 21 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

The way this captures sales and marketing activity is fantastic. I wish it were a little more transparent about the activities it excludes; I'm never trusting that it's not capturing emails that are excluded from tracking in HS or when I remove the tracking tags.,4 of 5,Oct 14 2021

The integration is great but the fact that you don't really have a 2 way sync is very disappointing.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

I love the fact that i can track emails and know if they've been opened but.... the integration of HubSpot into Outlook sucks and Outlook crashes if not every day certainly every second day because of that integration.,3 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Works very well compared to our previous CRM Microsoft Dynamics. I think there are a few functionalities (as stated above) that could be improved but love the ability to track emails and to create deals and tasks directly from the email.,4 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either. My phone now is the only place that I can see all of my calendars and contacts in one place for example. So thumbs way down.,2 of 5,Sep 7 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

It's just a tool - but a necessary tool... When dealing with customers who also have Outlook it's important to match them,3 of 5,Oct 28 2021

really poor most of the time we have to turn on HubSpot add-ins manually although it is pinned after 2-3 emails it gets turned off and every time it requires manual action to turn it on.,2 of 5,Oct 27 2021

Outlook is fine but when I tried to send an email through HubSpot's Outlook integration to keep track of the emails regarding a support ticket two of the recipients I specified in the HubSpot mail client were missed out of the generated email and I did not realise until 3 days later when one of them emailed me asking for an update.,1 of 5,Oct 22 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

The integration is great but the fact that you don't really have a 2 way sync is very disappointing.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot.

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

the add in always drops out and i have to re-upload it. the emails never link to the right accounts so i end up with 30 different wrong contacts on one account and it is a ball ache to try and correct. also if you don't correct this error these email will forever go to the wrong profile,1 of 5,Nov 2 2021

It's easy to sync the outlook and HubSpot emails with the connection. Sometimes mail are sent from HubSpot and sometimes from outlook depending on situation. With the systems synced I can see history from both places with ease.,4 of 5,Oct 29 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly.

I've looked through the resources and apparently it's a new mac thing which seems a but outdated from such a powerful global crm.,1 of 5,Jul 29 2021

Terrible support and unable to use the plugin in Mac........................,1 of 5,Jul 28 2021

Die Zuverlässigkeit ist sehr gut. Es fehlen noch einige Funktionen. Z.B. dass ich auch den Posteingang per Klick protokollieren kann und nicht dafür die forward Adresse eingeben muss. Dass die kürzlichen Aktivitäten und die fälligen Aufgaben sich nicht zur passenden Email Adresse synchronisieren. Sprich ich rufe eine Email auf und sehe die passenden Aktivitäten und Aufgaben.,3 of 5,Jul 27 2021

The tool is simple to use however it does not allow for linking emails to the customer profile in HubSpot unless a copy is sent to the client. Ideally we would like to be able to also link internal conversations to company/deal profiles as needed.,4 of 5,Jul 27 2021

Me permite hacer muchas cosas con los emails. Me ha ahorrado mucho tiempo en tareas con los emails. HubSpot para Outlook me permite hacer cosas que no puedo sólo con Outlook pero es frustrante que me pida los datos de acceso cada vez que reinicio el pc aunque marque la casilla de mantenerme conectado. ¿Es un fallo de la app?,5 of 5,Jul 26 2021

It works well so far similar to Dynamics and I am sure other CRM programs.,4 of 5,Jul 26 2021

Most of the issues I have are with the current version of Outlook for Mac. This is really not an issue with HubSpot per se. However the HubSpot integration with Outlook is spotty with performance degradation as the host Outlook application and the HubSpot plug-in try to connect to their respective servers.,2 of 5,Jul 22 2021

Es una herramienta muy útil para nosotros porque brinda la opción de poder acceder al correo vía web desde cualquier lugar,5 of 5,Jul 22 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't. When someone I email 10 times a day are all put into the CRM it makes finding the conversation or information like finding a needle in a haystack. I wanted to upgrade 4 users but lacking the freedome for email control busts the need.,1 of 5,Jul 17 2021

Not having the ability to automatically create video/audio calls with teams causes me a lot of duplicated work; I have to create another event organically in Teams and send to team/cohort members.

The issue I have is that the clunky implementation of the login into hubstpot from the outlook login I have had to log in multiple times. As this cnanot be performed with a password manager the process is annoying and clunky. Log in should be persisten.

My outlook integration is not working and support has been communicating with me for weeks. I receive no emails into HubSpot and it is very frustrating,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email . When you search outlook you should find all pipelines companies and names in HubSpot directly from outlook page and on the right side of the page i want to see the HubSpot information about the company and contacts on the side .,3 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing. I would like everything to be in one place but HubSpot isn't as simple to use for email replys and it's difficult to find the forwarding BCC email address in order to add an email to a contact,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

I have used Outlook for many years and it works well. The integration with HubSpot is very good.,5 of 5,Dec 8 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them.

Outlook is great and our main form of communication. Just could not get it to connect properly to HubSpot and didn't feel like we could get proper support at HubSpot to correct the problem. Super bummed.,1 of 5,Oct 7 2021

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

I'm going to be discontinuing using it as I have had clients who previously had no trouble receiving emails start having my emails go to their junk folder.,3 of 5,Oct 3 2021

Nos ha solucionado muchos temas en cuanto a la organización de la información estadísticas etc.,3 of 5,Sep 30 2021

On a Mac the HubSpot Add-in will only link to the Microsoft account you have signed into Outlook with it will not link to any other email account - even if you are using Outlook to check email from another provider.,1 of 5,Sep 30 2021

Outlook is working very well but I can't synchronize with HubSpot and I would like to know how can I solve it,2 of 5,Sep 29 2021

HubSpot loses it's loging 2-3 timse a month and this is damn annoying. Even using "remember me" it loses connectivity.,3 of 5,Sep 29 2021

It's good - integrates easily with Outlook and is user friendly. I like that it remembers who conversations with and logs their response automatically.,4 of 5,Sep 28 2021

HubSpot keeps asking me to login even when I tell it to remember me. It cannot tell me who opened an email only "someone" - with multiple people copied that does not help very much.,2 of 5,Sep 28 2021

HubSpot plugin does not work on Outlook Mac (Microsoft Business Standard package) — support is not helpful very little detail or information on how to troubleshoot on your website,1 of 5,Sep 28 2021

Outlook is working fine but it's the HubSpot integration that is giving me issues.,2 of 5,Sep 27 2021

Without Outlook we'd not be able to function. The plugin with HubSpot is honestly a bit wonky though. It's forced through Microsoft365 so that it's always there. It's stalled quite a few users though and we need to ensure that the plugin operates all the time.,3 of 5,Sep 24 2021

Its great. I love that I can simply add a contact to the database or look a contact up right from my Outlook account.,5 of 5,Sep 23 2021

Sim o Outlook funciona perfeito e a integração com o Hbspot facilita muito atualizar e seguir com os follow-ups das oportunidades.,5 of 5,Sep 23 2021

as the plug in simply isn't working the is bringing frustration to the business and NO benefits,1 of 5,Sep 22 2021

No need to go into HubSpot for each prospect/customer insights. All necessary information available from within you Outlook,5 of 5,Sep 22 2021

I really hate this need to provide extra content... I'm busy. lkjflkjsaflkjsflkjsadlkjs,2 of 5,Sep 21 2021

It's a very helpful tool as an add-on to HubSpot but as mentioned above would be nice if it only tracked emails I asked it to or at least give me the option to switch tracking on/off,1 of 5,Sep 21 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

Sim funciona bem mas com HubSpot consigo segregar melhor meus leads. ooooo,4 of 5,Sep 20 2021

Outlook funciona bien. El problema está en el complemento con HubSpot. Muchas veces se trancan los correos salientes.,3 of 5,Sep 17 2021

I wouldn't use the plugin. Use BCC if you can remember. The plugin slows Outlook to a crawl regardless of what you're trying to to (email / calendar).,1 of 5,Sep 17 2021

very difficult to work with. Confusing to set up. No documentation or phone support.,2 of 5,Sep 16 2021

We should have access to tutorials to understand and implement all functionalities.,5 of 5,Sep 16 2021

Outlook is alright but Id still prefer gmail over it. Outlook doesnt allow you to search comms easily unless the person has replied to you. Whereas in gmail you can pull up conversations seamlessly without any requirements.,2 of 5,Sep 15 2021

bem mas a sincronização e o acoplamento são ruins precisa melhorar inclusive na forma de fazer o acomplamento é pouco intuitivo,3 of 5,Sep 15 2021

I love the fact that it offers everything we need! From syncing with our other software applications our customer's calendars. my personal calendar. In addition to I'm a HUGE fan of Microsoft Teams!,5 of 5,Sep 14 2021

It's not working. It states that it is working but not with all the contacts and not with everyone.,2 of 5,Sep 14 2021

Outlook is very important for communication with clients and sharing pertinent information internally.,5 of 5,Sep 13 2021

Works well. Very good Idea beats Salesforce. I like the ease of it but have not worked long enough with the programm to give a final feedback about it.,4 of 5,Sep 13 2021

Outlook is working well for my regular communications. However I can see the benefits of using HubSpot and I do realize that it will time to become familiar and comfortable using HubSpot.,4 of 5,Sep 12 2021

Algunas veces tiene problemas. Se podría mejorar la aplicación incorporando algunos elementos de compatibilidad,5 of 5,Sep 11 2021

I love using Outlook. It is so easy to use and the integration between HubSpot and Outlook is so easy! It literally keeps track of all the emails I am sending to my customers so that I do not have to jump between the two systems. I can go to HubSpot and see every interaction with a particular customer without needing to search for them constantly in Outlook.,5 of 5,Sep 9 2021

die Integration funktioniert nicht bzw.hat ein Eigenleben wlches der Support nicht lösen kann,1 of 5,Sep 9 2021

I love the fact that i can track emails and know if they've been opened but.... the integration of HubSpot into Outlook sucks and Outlook crashes if not every day certainly every second day because of that integration.,3 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Works very well compared to our previous CRM Microsoft Dynamics. I think there are a few functionalities (as stated above) that could be improved but love the ability to track emails and to create deals and tasks directly from the email.,4 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either. My phone now is the only place that I can see all of my calendars and contacts in one place for example. So thumbs way down.,2 of 5,Sep 7 2021

Ha sido muy práctico permite un seguimiento puntual de los visitantes clientes e interesados en nuestros servicios.,5 of 5,Sep 7 2021

Simple...just remember to use it on all communications. If you don't it might not sync up.,4 of 5,Sep 4 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Outlook funktioniert gut aber die Verbindung mit HubSpot nicht wirklich. Die Benutzerfreundlichkeit lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig.,1 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Outlook is the corporate communications platform and we must ensure all platforms we use can be integrated with Outlook in some way.,4 of 5,Sep 3 2021

it can be very beneficial unfortunately it just doesn't always go through.,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

This app was very simple to install and set-up. We have been using it for several months and it is working great.,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

L'intégration ne fonctionne pas dans Environnement Mac Os et l'on retrouve pas la snippet dans Outlook,2 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The HubSpot integration allows me to see when my receivers open my emails which helps me follow up effectively.,5 of 5,Sep 1 2021

Lo dicho una funcionalidad mediocre e incómoda. No quiero trabajar con Outlook ya que el CRM tiene la gestión de correos SOLO querría el CRM y olvidarme de Outlook. Pero no puedo hacerlo porque los nuevos correos de contactos existentes no me llegan. Una decepción.,2 of 5,Sep 1 2021

outlook works well for our business as all on Microsoft but the HubSpot integration for outlook must be selected every time you send an email I was previously on google and you just signed in and it took care of the rest.,2 of 5,Sep 1 2021

Experiência fantástica de uso. Rastreamento de email link para reuniões modelos e snippets disponíveis dentro do outlook,5 of 5,Aug 30 2021

Love being able to integrate the 2 programs - but the add on has made my outlook act very funky  slow and unusable at times ... when switching from calendar to email views- the screen will lag and not be completely viewabl e,1 of 5,Aug 30 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook. The add-in is very comfortable to use but my desktop Outlook keeps shutting it down as it constantly crashes it.. Also - it's very annoying that you have to log in every time and it doesn't remember you.,2 of 5,Aug 29 2021

The Outlook integration is great when it works correctly. often I have to "pop-out" my email to make the HubSpot functions available otherwise they're grayed out. Also can lock up Outlook for several minutes at a time.,3 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Leider vergisst das Add-On immer die Zugangsdaten. Das Add-On ist damit einfach nicht sinnvoll nutzbar. In der Hilfe sind dazu keine sinnvollen Informationen zu finden. Die Internet-Optionen in der Art und Weise zu öffnen ist leider keine Option.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

HubSpot keeps freezing and crashing in Outlook causing me to have to disable it or not keep it running meaning I have to try and remember to log emails as and when necessary.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

We have swapped to G Suite and now all working well. We were using Office 365 that we had purchased through GoDaddy - this prevented the integration from working properly.,2 of 5,Aug 27 2021

Unable to use it the way I would like to use the add on. Would like to see a window into HubSpot about that contact and not just use it for logging considering I can't manage my communications in HubSpot.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

It works well to add and track emails we receive and send out to customers. I would ideally like to see the adding of the BCC address more automated like it happens with the Gmail add-in. Right now you have to remember to click on the add-in to have the email tracked and recorded.,4 of 5,Aug 19 2021

This works fine when you can log into it. Other than that it is okay to use.,4 of 5,Aug 17 2021

Well I used get notifications from HubSpot whenever someone opened the email I sent (tracking emails) but then it just stopped. These notifications are important for me to followup on people interested in what we are providing. Do you guys know how to turn it back on?,3 of 5,Aug 17 2021

I feel this is a breach of privacy integrity and confidentiality for both myself and my clients and is not in accordance with the laws of my jurisdiction,1 of 5,Aug 16 2021

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook sucks! I have been using HubSpot in conjunction with GSuite - and it has been a dream. With O365 now I have no sense of how the integration is working.,2 of 5,Aug 12 2021

Impact majeur pour assurer le succès de mes entreprises. Cet outil jumeler à HubSpot me permet de mieux performer quotidiennement.,5 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email .

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

Works well though prefer gsuit overall because integrates better. But I use outlook for all of my emails and it seems to work fine and I like the HubSpot tab. I like being able to track emails and also use templates for all of my various emails related to my customers.,4 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either. My phone now is the only place that I can see all of my calendars and contacts in one place for example. So thumbs way down.,2 of 5,Sep 7 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

It's easy to sync the outlook and HubSpot emails with the connection. Sometimes mail are sent from HubSpot and sometimes from outlook depending on situation. With the systems synced I can see history from both places with ease.,4 of 5,Oct 29 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

Outlook is fine but when I tried to send an email through HubSpot's Outlook integration to keep track of the emails regarding a support ticket two of the recipients I specified in the HubSpot mail client were missed out of the generated email and I did not realise until 3 days later when one of them emailed me asking for an update.,1 of 5,Oct 22 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot.

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

Outlook works well but the link between Outlook and HubSpot is not always consistent and causes Outlook to crash.,1 of 5,Nov 11 2021

Outlook me parece una herramienta muy útil de fácil uso para enviar y recibir correo,3 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Overall it works well. With one big exception. The calendar! HubSpot does not create property/value for the meeting date and time when the meeting is set using the outlook integration. This causes lots of issues for us that we have to put in manual work arounds to address.,3 of 5,Aug 9 2021

Outlook has everything I need from a mail client. I'm not interested in switching mail client.,3 of 5,Aug 9 2021

They work well individually not together a lot of messing about I want simplicity,3 of 5,Aug 6 2021

It's frustrating to use at times when the addon triggers a cursor jump to the end of the email since it's inserting the tracking pixel. This often means that I start typing at the end of the email.,3 of 5,Aug 5 2021

I have multiple businesses and inboxes. HubSpot integration is all or nothing. I have no ability to only integrate certain inboxes,2 of 5,Aug 5 2021

Outook por si solo funciona bien rapido y efectivo.

HubSpot is great however integration with outlook is not on point yet. Due to two-factor authentication complete and automatic linking of in and outgoing e-mails is not entirely correct.,2 of 5,Aug 3 2021

Impact majeur pour assurer le succès de mes entreprises. Cet outil jumeler à HubSpot me permet de mieux performer quotidiennement.,5 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Outlook ist für mich ein Tool in dem ein Großteil meiner Kommunikationskanäle aufläuft. Die Integration von HubSpot in Outlook hilft mir dabei nicht mehrere Orte des Fokus schaffen zu müssen und zwischen Systemen hin und her zu springen und dabei Ablenkung zu erzeugen.,4 of 5,Jul 30 2021

Outlook works well for what we do as a business. Outlook 365'has taken some getting used to. Hub spot so far has been awesome.,4 of 5,Jul 29 2021

Outlook is out email server and if I have full integration it makes my emails sooooo slow that I have to wait to start typing an emails o that HubSpot can catch up.

Die Zuverlässigkeit ist sehr gut. Es fehlen noch einige Funktionen. Z.B. dass ich auch den Posteingang per Klick protokollieren kann und nicht dafür die forward Adresse eingeben muss.

Me permite hacer muchas cosas con los emails. Me ha ahorrado mucho tiempo en tareas con los emails. HubSpot para Outlook me permite hacer cosas que no puedo sólo con Outlook pero es frustrante que me pida los datos de acceso cada vez que reinicio el pc aunque marque la casilla de mantenerme conectado. ¿Es un fallo de la app?,5 of 5,Jul 26 2021

It works well so far similar to Dynamics and I am sure other CRM programs.,4 of 5,Jul 26 2021

Most of the issues I have are with the current version of Outlook for Mac. This is really not an issue with HubSpot per se. However the HubSpot integration with Outlook is spotty with performance degradation as the host Outlook application and the HubSpot plug-in try to connect to their respective servers.,2 of 5,Jul 22 2021

Es una herramienta muy útil para nosotros porque brinda la opción de poder acceder al correo vía web desde cualquier lugar,5 of 5,Jul 22 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't. When someone I email 10 times a day are all put into the CRM it makes finding the conversation or information like finding a needle in a haystack. I wanted to upgrade 4 users but lacking the freedome for email control busts the need.,1 of 5,Jul 17 2021

The issue I have is that the clunky implementation of the login into hubstpot from the outlook login I have had to log in multiple times. As this cnanot be performed with a password manager the process is annoying and clunky. Log in should be persisten. Login should also be linked to Outlook profiles and even better to the account email is sent from becuse if I mix my emails between different accounts and for different purposes I do not want to have to remember to either swith tracking on or off.,3 of 5,Jul 13 2021

My outlook integration is not working and support has been communicating with me for weeks. I receive no emails into HubSpot and it is very frustrating,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email . When you search outlook you should find all pipelines companies and names in HubSpot directly from outlook page and on the right side of the page i want to see the HubSpot information about the company and contacts on the side .,3 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing. I would like everything to be in one place but HubSpot isn't as simple to use for email replys and it's difficult to find the forwarding BCC email address in order to add an email to a contact,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

HubSpot integration for Outlook 365 using on MacOS Outlook client works not very well. There are some bugs and errors that are not observed in the add-in for Windows. In fact I don't use this add-in due to this problems.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

Outlook is great HubSpot is great Outlook + HubSpot is a pain.

After installing the HubSpot plug-in for Outlook all of my new/unread emails are showing up as read. There are no resources available to free users. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating and time consuming it is to see my inbox showing up as unread when I haven't read a single one. My outlook settings are not set to have reading panes or previews so there is nothing on my end. This only started after installing the HubSpot plug-in.,1 of 5,Jun 29 2021

As you might know Outlook storage is limited. Many CRMs offer the following functionality: Once Outlook letter is processed (added to Portal/CRM system or sent from Portal/CRM system) the same corresponding letter gets deleted from Outlook mailbox. Check out OTRS functionality for example. So basically that would be really helpful if you could add this feature to your Outlook integration.

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

Outlook me parece una herramienta muy útil de fácil uso para enviar y recibir correo,3 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email .

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

As you might know Outlook storage is limited.

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool.

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

Absolutely love this integration. It saves so much time and helps keep things organized. Suggestions: - track emails that were sent as BCC. - the ability to 'untrack' a certain email after it was sent with tracking on.,4 of 5,Nov 10 2021

The function is not as efficient as it could be. It would be nice if it was possible to exclude emails from specific senders or with specific subjects. Too many unnecessary tickets are created from unimportant emails.,3 of 5,Nov 10 2021

Outlook me parece una herramienta muy útil de fácil uso para enviar y recibir correo,3 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

It's easy to sync the outlook and HubSpot emails with the connection. Sometimes mail are sent from HubSpot and sometimes from outlook depending on situation. With the systems synced I can see history from both places with ease.,4 of 5,Oct 29 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

Outlook is fine but when I tried to send an email through HubSpot's Outlook integration to keep track of the emails regarding a support ticket two of the recipients I specified in the HubSpot mail client were missed out of the generated email and I did not realise until 3 days later when one of them emailed me asking for an update.,1 of 5,Oct 22 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool.

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool.

Gmail is so much better with HubSpot but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.,1 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

Love being able to integrate the 2 programs - but the add on has made my outlook act very funky  slow and unusable at times ... when switching from calendar to email views- the screen will lag and not be completely viewabl e,1 of 5,Aug 30 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook. The add-in is very comfortable to use but my desktop Outlook keeps shutting it down as it constantly crashes it.. Also - it's very annoying that you have to log in every time and it doesn't remember you.,2 of 5,Aug 29 2021

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Impact majeur pour assurer le succès de mes entreprises. Cet outil jumeler à HubSpot me permet de mieux performer quotidiennement.,5 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Most of the issues I have are with the current version of Outlook for Mac. This is really not an issue with HubSpot per se.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email .

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

As you might know Outlook storage is limited.

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

Outlook works great but the HubSpot plug in is hopeless. It slows everything down and pops up in the wrong place blocking Outlook functionality. Also very painful to choose whether or not an email is tracked etc,1 of 5,Jun 8 2021

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team. But the biggest element that we needed to change internally was how we invited customers to meetings. Specifically speeding up the process and simplifying it for everyone. Now calendar invites are sent with ease and everything moves along quickly.,4 of 5,Jun 7 2021

Outlook cumple su función su plugin de Hub Spot también pero aveces lo alenta. El código de rastreo lo pone por default y a veces se me olvida borrarlo es lo de menos pero sería mejor que te pregunte o se ponga con un click para facilitar cuando si se quiere rastrear un correo.,3 of 5,Jun 5 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

I love using Outlook. It is so easy to use and the integration between HubSpot and Outlook is so easy! It literally keeps track of all the emails I am sending to my customers so that I do not have to jump between the two systems. I can go to HubSpot and see every interaction with a particular customer without needing to search for them constantly in Outlook.,5 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!).

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

working well - HubSpot has enhanced the email experience between myself and members. I can see how many times an important email I sent was opened and helps me better gauge my contact efforts with members. It also helpful to quickly retrieve this information to give to my team and management for a meeting and also helpful when other people on my team can easily go to the service ticket and see my correspondence with members.,5 of 5,Jun 24 2021

Outlook is great HubSpot for Outlook is trash. Loads half the time has no tickets or service desk functionality at all.,1 of 5,Jun 23 2021

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

En general funciona correctamente pero la experiencia no es trnasparente por ejemplo al enviar correos desde HubSpot se puede programar seguimiento y desde Outlook no.

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team.

En general la aplicación funciona y lo hace de manera adecuada. La integración es sencilla sin llegar a ser espectacular porque te obliga a utilizar HubSpot para interactuar es decir si mandas el correo directo desde outlook no tiene el mismo tratamiento.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The way this captures sales and marketing activity is fantastic. I wish it were a little more transparent about the activities it excludes; I'm never trusting that it's not capturing emails that are excluded from tracking in HS or when I remove the tracking tags.,4 of 5,Oct 14 2021

The integration is great but the fact that you don't really have a 2 way sync is very disappointing.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it. One of the reasons I use it the most is for attaching my meeting link and I find myself copying it directly from HubSpot rather than the integration since it works so infrequently.,2 of 5,Sep 20 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!).

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks.

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing. I would like everything to be in one place but HubSpot isn't as simple to use for email replys and it's difficult to find the forwarding BCC email address in order to add an email to a contact,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

After installing the HubSpot plug-in for Outlook all of my new/unread emails are showing up as read. There are no resources available to free users. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating and time consuming it is to see my inbox showing up as unread when I haven't read a single one.

As you might know Outlook storage is limited. Many CRMs offer the following functionality: Once Outlook letter is processed (added to Portal/CRM system or sent from Portal/CRM system) the same corresponding letter gets deleted from Outlook mailbox. Check out OTRS functionality for example. So basically that would be really helpful if you could add this feature to your Outlook integration.

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

Outlook works well but the link between Outlook and HubSpot is not always consistent and causes Outlook to crash.,1 of 5,Nov 11 2021

Outlook me parece una herramienta muy útil de fácil uso para enviar y recibir correo,3 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

Outlook serves the expected purpose of our needs and as a coorporation it is by all means a known software for a lot of people.

Very good experience in general. Outlook becomes a bit slower when HubSpot is embeded.,4 of 5,Oct 6 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

Overall it works well. With one big exception. The calendar! HubSpot does not create property/value for the meeting date and time when the meeting is set using the outlook integration. This causes lots of issues for us that we have to put in manual work arounds to address.,3 of 5,Aug 9 2021

Impact majeur pour assurer le succès de mes entreprises. Cet outil jumeler à HubSpot me permet de mieux performer quotidiennement.,5 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

Most of the issues I have are with the current version of Outlook for Mac. This is really not an issue with HubSpot per se.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't.

My outlook integration is not working and support has been communicating with me for weeks. I receive no emails into HubSpot and it is very frustrating,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email . When you search outlook you should find all pipelines companies and names in HubSpot directly from outlook page and on the right side of the page i want to see the HubSpot information about the company and contacts on the side .,3 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

As you might know Outlook storage is limited. Many CRMs offer the following functionality: Once Outlook letter is processed (added to Portal/CRM system or sent from Portal/CRM system) the same corresponding letter gets deleted from Outlook mailbox.

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team.

Outlook is our major email source we would also like to track those emails on HubSpot which does not seem to be working at the moment,3 of 5,May 25 2021

Outlook is great and works seamlessly - except for your plugin which is poorly integrated has conflict issues and sometimes just stops working. I like the idea of it and wish it worked better. It's been like this for years since it was called Sidekick.,2 of 5,May 24 2021

It is helping us to keep track of what we've said to who and how often. I wish it was a bit more intelligent - focused just on the one account that I have in my outlook not my personal account too. I also wish I understood a bit more about how it picks up what to track. But generally considering we've only been using it in our business for last couple of weeks we're finding it helpful.,3 of 5,May 24 2021

I think I'd like some richer integration like the ability to have it place phone calls via HubSpot but through outlook IF needed.,4 of 5,May 19 2021

So far Not a very pleasant experience. There are a lot of features that seem basic that are not part of the add in. Also some features are bugged.,1 of 5,May 19 2021

The previous versions of this had a good feature where you could see deals etc... associated with the contact you were emailing now there's nothing.,2 of 5,Mar 24 2021

I have 12 members of staff most of which have now given up with the integration. It kills Outlook performance end up missing characters when typing the BCC wont clear unless you delete it several times ! As the Add-In refreshes it causes Outlook to pause. Cursor doesn't always remain in correct position when starting an email ) I have logged this several times HubSpot reply with a whole list of things to try - Why not not admit the product has problems and come clean with the users.

Works well though prefer gsuit overall because integrates better. But I use outlook for all of my emails and it seems to work fine and I like the HubSpot tab. I like being able to track emails and also use templates for all of my various emails related to my customers.,4 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

There seems to be a lot of functionality with both Gmail and Outlook 365 but very little to none with Outlook Exchange which seems to still be in the beta version and with so many different workarounds involved to get the most basic of functionality,3 of 5,Dec 1 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

HubSpot is very easy to navigate user friendly and offers good functions even with the free version. However ever since adding the HubSpot integration into outlook it runs slow freezes and fails regularly requiring restart of outlook.,3 of 5,Nov 6 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

I wouldn't use the plugin. Use BCC if you can remember. The plugin slows Outlook to a crawl regardless of what you're trying to to (email / calendar).,1 of 5,Sep 17 2021

very difficult to work with. Confusing to set up. No documentation or phone support.,2 of 5,Sep 16 2021

Outlook is alright but Id still prefer gmail over it. Outlook doesnt allow you to search comms easily unless the person has replied to you. Whereas in gmail you can pull up conversations seamlessly without any requirements.,2 of 5,Sep 15 2021

Algunas veces tiene problemas. Se podría mejorar la aplicación incorporando algunos elementos de compatibilidad,5 of 5,Sep 11 2021

I love using Outlook. It is so easy to use and the integration between HubSpot and Outlook is so easy! It literally keeps track of all the emails I am sending to my customers so that I do not have to jump between the two systems. I can go to HubSpot and see every interaction with a particular customer without needing to search for them constantly in Outlook.,5 of 5,Sep 9 2021

die Integration funktioniert nicht bzw.hat ein Eigenleben wlches der Support nicht lösen kann,1 of 5,Sep 9 2021

I love the fact that i can track emails and know if they've been opened but.... the integration of HubSpot into Outlook sucks and Outlook crashes if not every day certainly every second day because of that integration.,3 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Works very well compared to our previous CRM Microsoft Dynamics. I think there are a few functionalities (as stated above) that could be improved but love the ability to track emails and to create deals and tasks directly from the email.,4 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either. My phone now is the only place that I can see all of my calendars and contacts in one place for example. So thumbs way down.,2 of 5,Sep 7 2021

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The integration works really well for us. We've had no problems at all and found that the support has been really good each time we've had a question (however silly the question actually is!). Being able to use the integration within the HubSpot CRM means we just log into one place to do everything communications wise with customers (other than phone calls but we'll be integrating that soon too!) and that saves time!,5 of 5,Sep 2 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook. The add-in is very comfortable to use but my desktop Outlook keeps shutting it down as it constantly crashes it.. Also - it's very annoying that you have to log in every time and it doesn't remember you.,2 of 5,Aug 29 2021

HubSpot keeps freezing and crashing in Outlook causing me to have to disable it or not keep it running meaning I have to try and remember to log emails as and when necessary.,1 of 5,Aug 27 2021

I feel this is a breach of privacy integrity and confidentiality for both myself and my clients and is not in accordance with the laws of my jurisdiction,1 of 5,Aug 16 2021

Easy installation of plugin works fast. In my work it is most important to get known unfinished pending issues like Sales Order number in system and tracking number for shipment. These two things are the things I needed to dig up from notes and paper notes. While you're out of office it also cuts off 'response time' when I can check these things very quickly. So far the plugin is not showing all needed information but helps a lot to jump into customer record. I would recommend to use HubSpot plugin with Outlook.,3 of 5,Aug 13 2021

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work. So my review is less of HubSpot or Outlook and more of the integration between the two.,1 of 5,Aug 2 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

It also helpful to quickly retrieve this information to give to my team and management for a meeting and also helpful when other people on my team can easily go to the service ticket and see my correspondence with members.,5 of 5,Jun 24 2021

Outlook is great HubSpot for Outlook is trash. Loads half the time has no tickets or service desk functionality at all.,1 of 5,Jun 23 2021

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

En general funciona correctamente pero la experiencia no es trnasparente por ejemplo al enviar correos desde HubSpot se puede programar seguimiento y desde Outlook no.

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team. But the biggest element that we needed to change internally was how we invited customers to meetings. Specifically speeding up the process and simplifying it for everyone.

En general la aplicación funciona y lo hace de manera adecuada. La integración es sencilla sin llegar a ser espectacular porque te obliga a utilizar HubSpot para interactuar es decir si mandas el correo directo desde outlook no tiene el mismo tratamiento.

HubSpot ADD IN FOR OUTLOOK NOT WORKING HubSpot’s Add in extensions slow up Outlook performance - not sure if this is an Outlook or HubSpot issue. Currently HubSpot add ins not working with Outlook at all it’s a known issue with Microsoft and HubSpot. Both HubSpot and Microsoft have opportunity to improve native integration. MICROSOFT TEAMS HubSpot still to this date only supports zoom. Not able to use Microsoft Teams for virtual meetings and meeting invite - is a massive downfall.

It is helping us to keep track of what we've said to who and how often. I wish it was a bit more intelligent - focused just on the one account that I have in my outlook not my personal account too.

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges.

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use.

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually. It also strips random formatting out if you open the add-on after the initial email is composed. Overall we have to use it but it's not great.,3 of 5,Oct 5 2021

The HubSpot integration with outlook only offers minimal HubSpot tools and is only functional less than half the time. I find myself uninstalling and reinstalling it more than using it.

Dass die kürzlichen Aktivitäten und die fälligen Aufgaben sich nicht zur passenden Email Adresse synchronisieren. Sprich ich rufe eine Email auf und sehe die passenden Aktivitäten und Aufgaben.,3 of 5,Jul 27 2021

Me permite hacer muchas cosas con los emails. Me ha ahorrado mucho tiempo en tareas con los emails. HubSpot para Outlook me permite hacer cosas que no puedo sólo con Outlook pero es frustrante que me pida los datos de acceso cada vez que reinicio el pc aunque marque la casilla de mantenerme conectado. ¿Es un fallo de la app?,5 of 5,Jul 26 2021

It works well so far similar to Dynamics and I am sure other CRM programs.,4 of 5,Jul 26 2021

Most of the issues I have are with the current version of Outlook for Mac. This is really not an issue with HubSpot per se. However the HubSpot integration with Outlook is spotty with performance degradation as the host Outlook application and the HubSpot plug-in try to connect to their respective servers.,2 of 5,Jul 22 2021

Es una herramienta muy útil para nosotros porque brinda la opción de poder acceder al correo vía web desde cualquier lugar,5 of 5,Jul 22 2021

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks. I also create wordpress sites for clients and this is my go-to plugin for CRM.,4 of 5,Jul 20 2021

We aren't a sales call center or so. Many of the emails are of a general nature or involve in-depth solutions for a particular case. There are emails worth saving and those that aren't. When someone I email 10 times a day are all put into the CRM it makes finding the conversation or information like finding a needle in a haystack. I wanted to upgrade 4 users but lacking the freedome for email control busts the need.,1 of 5,Jul 17 2021

Not having the ability to automatically create video/audio calls with teams causes me a lot of duplicated work; I have to create another event organically in Teams and send to team/cohort members.

The issue I have is that the clunky implementation of the login into hubstpot from the outlook login I have had to log in multiple times. As this cnanot be performed with a password manager the process is annoying and clunky. Log in should be persisten. Login should also be linked to Outlook profiles and even better to the account email is sent from becuse if I mix my emails between different accounts and for different purposes I do not want to have to remember to either swith tracking on or off.,3 of 5,Jul 13 2021

My outlook integration is not working and support has been communicating with me for weeks. I receive no emails into HubSpot and it is very frustrating,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

Outlook is ok but the integration with HubSpot needs to be upgraded in such a way that whenever you hover on one new contact outlook should show and record contact into your contact list and relate it with the email . When you search outlook you should find all pipelines companies and names in HubSpot directly from outlook page and on the right side of the page i want to see the HubSpot information about the company and contacts on the side .,3 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I love using outlook but HubSpot doesn't sync with Outlook 365 through Godaddy which is dissappointing. I would like everything to be in one place but HubSpot isn't as simple to use for email replys and it's difficult to find the forwarding BCC email address in order to add an email to a contact,1 of 5,Jul 12 2021

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it. One source of frustration is when we enter a contact in to HubSpot their email and contact info does not come over to Outlook. We have installed and re-installed the connector but same results. Pretty frustrating.,2 of 5,Jul 8 2021

After installing the HubSpot plug-in for Outlook all of my new/unread emails are showing up as read. There are no resources available to free users. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating and time consuming it is to see my inbox showing up as unread when I haven't read a single one.

As you might know Outlook storage is limited. Many CRMs offer the following functionality: Once Outlook letter is processed (added to Portal/CRM system or sent from Portal/CRM system) the same corresponding letter gets deleted from Outlook mailbox. Check out OTRS functionality for example. So basically that would be really helpful if you could add this feature to your Outlook integration. If HubSpot will be able to delete processed letters from Outlook mailboxes that should really help us your customers.,3 of 5,Jun 25 2021

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team.

I reported a ticket some time ago and was told this was not a HubSpot issue it was a problem with Microsoft Outlook. Many new versions of Outlook have been released and it still doesnt work. When replying to an email and adding tracking too it the formatting of the email gets subtly changed and when viewed by the receiving party using Outlook on Windows comes up with a contacting server loading message.,1 of 5,Dec 16 2020

Very satisfied works for the applications and purposes required. Used in conjunction with Office 365,4 of 5,Dec 16 2020

Highly recommend the HubSpot add in. It saves us time and easily reveals who the most interested prospects are.,5 of 5,Dec 14 2020

Seems to glitch out once in a while not always ready to track emails. I have to make sure with the add in side menu pinned and logged on,3 of 5,Dec 14 2020

Outlook me ha servido bien. La integración con HubSpot no fue de las mejores en el calendario pues como uso Google calendar debí configurar extra para que se reflejaran las reuniones y actividades. Pero al eliminar una cita en HubSpot no se elimina automáticamente de Calendar. Espero arreglen esto. Igual intentaré crear otra cuenta usando las herramientas de Google,2 of 5,Dec 14 2020

Integration between Outlook for Mac and HubSpot lacks features. Looks like integration is biased towards a Windows environment,3 of 5,Dec 14 2020

The integration with HubSpot and Outlook is working well as we recently rolled out Office 365 to our employees. I don't interact directly with my customers often but our sales department is using this feature and it's very helpful to get new contacts into our CRM.,4 of 5,Dec 10 2020

Inconsistent in connectivity tracking and duplicates. Sequences sent multiple times. Emails and invites are not always reflected.,1 of 5,Dec 10 2020

Outlook is great the HubSpot addition is awesome but when it is pinned and you are typing it takes a very long time for the letters to catch up it slows down the system when the extension is in use,2 of 5,Dec 10 2020

There is one feature that is available in Gmail that is not in Outlook. That is the ability to go to an email thread by following a link in the HubSpot activity feed in the same way as you can for Gmail. If I get a notification that 'someone' opened an email I have to search in Outlook to find out who that might be based on the email subject. With the Gmail integration you just click a link and are taken to the email. Also it is not very stable. The add-in crashes from time to time and fails to track. If you don't spot this you are sending emails that are not tracked which is not great. If you do spot it you have to restart Outlook to fix.,3 of 5,Dec 10 2020

I have used Outlook for many years and it works well. The integration with HubSpot is very good.,5 of 5,Dec 8 2021

Je connais et j'utilise Outlook depuis très longtemps. Je tiens à garder ce programme.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Works well though prefer gsuit overall because integrates better. But I use outlook for all of my emails and it seems to work fine and I like the HubSpot tab. I like being able to track emails and also use templates for all of my various emails related to my customers.,4 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Could be vastly improved. Every day when we come into work we have to open Outlook and then remember to open the HubSpot Sales Add-In. You then have to pin open the add-in every day and then click to log the email. By comparison Gmail opened automatically and would track unless you said otherwise which was much more efficient.,2 of 5,Dec 7 2021

Muito legal a funcionalidade de registrar interação no CRM do outlook porém a funcionalidade registra todos os contatos em cópia do e-mail que muitas vezes não são clientes seria excelente se fosse possível escolher a qual e-mail associar os registros e não associar em todos em cópia pois isso acaba sujando a base.,3 of 5,Dec 6 2021

There seems to be a lot of functionality with both Gmail and Outlook 365 but very little to none with Outlook Exchange which seems to still be in the beta version and with so many different workarounds involved to get the most basic of functionality,3 of 5,Dec 1 2021

I recently connected my outlook to HubSpot however; nothing is tracking. No conversation history no email logs etc. Its essentially useless at this time,1 of 5,Dec 1 2021

Gmail is so much better with HubSpot but unfortunately stuck with MS for now.,1 of 5,Nov 30 2021

Outlook is working ok. On the other hand (not that you are asking about it) but HubSpot add-on is making Outlook fail sometimes the sidebar seems to be full of bugs email texts are appearing behind the sidebar with me not being able to see the rest of the text if not shutting the addon down.

HubSpot integration with Outlook has been a gamechanger for my business. Now I can initiate emails out of HubSpot and use Outlook to follow on while HubSpot continues to track each of the exchanges. It is helping me transition from excel spreadsheets and Outlook to a more singular CRM system which is HubSpot. I am currently using the free plan and while most CRM free versions do not include Outlook integration HubSpot does. This is the single most useful feature for me and I am grateful to HubSpot for providing this great service to me for free as I work hard to grow my business. Thank you!,5 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot add-on on Outlook drastically slows down Outlook - this is the only drawback otherwise it is well intended product.,2 of 5,Nov 18 2021

HubSpot's outlook extension keeps asking me to log in every week. It's a bit annoying.,1 of 5,Nov 18 2021

While the functionality of the Gmail/Outlook email extensions should be the same HubSpot for Outlook must be manually "turned on" every time you access outlook or send an email. While this is a simple change retraining a sales team to manually open their HubSpot add-in is not a welcome one. "Pinning" the HubSpot pane so it stays open has performed inconsistently. I'm sure these issues are on Outlooks side as otherwise the HubSpot add-in works well but because tracking and logging is the basis of the tool and this is no longer guaranteed when opening Outlook it's value is greatly diminished. It not takes more clicks to log an email than it does to forward an email to the HubSpot forwarding address.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

There are many issues with this integration first of all it only logs emails when the HubSpot extension tab is open but if you pin it open it obscures the email drafting real estate. The meeting link is fine but it doesn't let the user reschedule the event.,2 of 5,Nov 17 2021

The over-all experience with Microsoft is mind-blowing from where they were in the 90s. No more upgrades to the software it is done now by subscription as the updates roll out they are instantly added to one's subscription for use. A lot cheaper than paying $500.00 for the software each year as before and the increased turnaround time when calling (30-minutes or less) for assistance with software issues is a game changer as well.,5 of 5,Nov 12 2021

The problem is not Outlook. The problem is HubSpot. I am a small business and I have no tech support. I have up to five separate email accounts running from one Outlook system. I find managing HubSpot linking it to the correct email account and denying it access to the others extremely difficult. I do not have time to fiddle with it and learn how to make it work. I need a simple system that will connect my email contacts to their messages and make it easy to track communications with them. HubSpot makes it hard because it wants to run my life rather than just to meet my needs. It is as good as any but it doesn't work for me.,2 of 5,Nov 8 2021

The HubSpot plugin has been quite unreliable and forces me to use Gmail with the HubSpot plugin instead when sending critical emails. - The HubSpot plugin keeps saying that my Outlook account is not linked to HubSpot until I click the "From" email address and re-select the same email address - The email attachments sometimes disappear and are not sent along the email - With the plugin active the CPU usage sometimes go very high and kills battery life - The plugin sometimes shows "No Tracker ID" error messages when trying to click the Track Email checkbox,2 of 5,Oct 29 2021

Outlook is working perfectly fine. However I want to use the outlook from with CRM so that I can have everything in one place. I can only use a shared mailbox from within but I cannot use the personal (company) email id which defeats the whole purpose. Plus the account manager is more interested in selling the next level up subscriptions and cannot help with technical issues. Tried looking at the community but there is nothing. I am planning to upgrade the subscription but if this is how you treat your beginner/customer then I am really disappointed and will have to think twice before I upgrade.,1 of 5,Oct 28 2021

We work in a super sucre environment and we have to use a remote desktop and VPN. Everytime we log onto our remote desktop a random server is attributed to us to increase productivity. The HubSpot integration will be disconnected because of that all the time. I need to reinstall and reauthenticate the integration quite frequently and it's really not ideal. Although I understand the issue is coming from our hardcore security measures it would be good if a lighter version of the tracker existed or a better way to integrate outlook-HubSpot was offered for super secured environment.,2 of 5,Oct 20 2021

The integration with Outlook is important but it isn't very smooth. I should clarify that we are using Outlook app on desktop not the webmail version. If the add-on is pinned it slows everything way down to the point where it takes longer to compose and send an email than if I just hopped over to HubSpot to copy a meeting or document link manually.

I love using Outlook. It is so easy to use and the integration between HubSpot and Outlook is so easy! It literally keeps track of all the emails I am sending to my customers so that I do not have to jump between the two systems. I can go to HubSpot and see every interaction with a particular customer without needing to search for them constantly in Outlook.,5 of 5,Sep 9 2021

Outlook is fine but the integration with HubSpot doesn't seem to work. Outlook on my phone just adds a layer of conflict with my BB Hub email overlay on Android - it doesn't integrate there either.

When emailing someone for the first time if you toggle on the track and log it automatically sets the person as a Subscriber. The inability to change this is crippling. Salespeople can be reaching out to LEADS for the first time not people that've necessarily opted into marketing material. The fact that the Became a Subscriber Date is uneditable means uneditable wrong data that as far as I can think of right now means clean up for the gatekeeper of our data by way of deleting these contacts and reuploading them or having to ditch the extension,2 of 5,Sep 3 2021

The purpose of the integration for my company was to enable working with HubSpot (adding contacts responding and tracking email etc.) directly from outlook.

Outlook is good. The integration of a calendar into the same app as my email is very helpful and the daily reminders helps keep me on track. That said the integration with HubSpot is not good. The fact that I have to remember to add a bcc address on every email makes it inconsistent to keep track of my emails. On top of that Even when I have the integrated plugin for recording every communication automatically turned on it doesn’t work.

This plugin works great I really have no complaints. I would have given it a perfect rating if it wasn't for this: My suggestion: When using 2 different email addresses on outlook - the HubSpot app tracks all mails sent from both accounts because I can only sign in to one account at a time. It would be wonderful if we were able to sign into multiple accounts simultaneously. Also - if it were able to only track the emails from one of the accounts instead of all accounts on outlook. I hope this makes sense. Other than that - what an amazing tool well done guys! I love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks.

I appreciate the "add contact" feature within the new email window. I also appreciate that the email is automatically synced to the contact's record in HubSpot when you send an email. However an additional button to "sync" or "archive" an email you receive from a contact would be immensely helpful in tracking all communications (not just those you send out). Other CRMS have a similar functionality like SugarCRM "archive to sugar" where you select an email click archive and then Sugar attempts to identify the contact or business record associated by the email address. You can confirm (check or uncheck records) and then click archive. The message will then be associated with that record. Hopefully this is something that can be done in the future with HubSpot as currently I have to forward emails to the HubSpot email in the bcc and then manually associate it with the contact and deassociate it with my own email address.,3 of 5,Jul 8 2021

We are on Mac's so generally the functionality of Outlook for Mac is less than Windows but we live with it.

Outlook is great HubSpot for Outlook is trash. Loads half the time has no tickets or service desk functionality at all.,1 of 5,Jun 23 2021

I love Outlook and I was very excited to adopt HubSpot because we were told that it was able to integrate with Outlook which is one of the major reasons we chose to go with HubSpot as a CRM. However after purchasing HubSpot we found that the handy HubSpot tool that is present for personal email accounts does not show up for a shared inbox. Rendering that integration nearly useless for our purposes. After hours of tech calls we now have to decide to either use the "Conversations" feature in HubSpot as our communication tool exclusively or continue using Outlook the way we have been but without using the HubSpot integration tool. My understanding is that the issue is on Microsoft's end rather than HubSpot's but we should have been informed of this right away. Deeply disappointing.,1 of 5,Jun 22 2021

The HubSpot Outlook plug in is useful in automaticall linkeing email to my contacts deals and companies as well as linking calendars. The lack of being able to manually allocate an internal email to a deal within Outlook is something that would significantly increase efficiency.,4 of 5,Jun 21 2021

Outlook is working well however the HubSpot integration slows the Outlook program down significantly. Sometimes the integration is removed and we have to re-download and install which is less than ideal.,3 of 5,Jun 17 2021

I've noticed some bugs if you track an email once you have started writing and it has bullet points by clicking on the HubSpot button in Outlook it will knock out all the bullets and make the spacing go weird.,3 of 5,Jun 16 2021

Outlook working very well as ever. HubSpot integration less so - too many clicks required and separate loading of plugin windows login duplications etc. Long stream of additional actions to 'save' the tremendous burden of pasting in a Bcc address... Most other HubSpot functions accomplished more easily through the webapp.,1 of 5,Jun 14 2021

En general funciona correctamente pero la experiencia no es trnasparente por ejemplo al enviar correos desde HubSpot se puede programar seguimiento y desde Outlook no. Requiere habilidades para hacer uso del mismo por lo que conviene asesorarse. Importante anotar que para sincronizar contactos es otro proceso y ese es aun mas complicado.,4 of 5,Jun 12 2021

Outlook works great but the HubSpot plug in is hopeless. It slows everything down and pops up in the wrong place blocking Outlook functionality. Also very painful to choose whether or not an email is tracked etc,1 of 5,Jun 8 2021

No support. Free version was just as good. Can't speak with anyone at HubSpot without paying hundreds of dollars for support. Will most likely cancel subscription after 12 months and go back to free version.,2 of 5,Jun 8 2021

it is working very smoothly would definitely recommend it if you're not sure yet,5 of 5,Jun 8 2021

While I can use HubSpot in the email itself (when using Chrome or the Outlook App) I haven't gotten to that point with my team. But the biggest element that we needed to change internally was how we invited customers to meetings. Specifically speeding up the process and simplifying it for everyone. Now calendar invites are sent with ease and everything moves along quickly.,4 of 5,Jun 7 2021

Outlook cumple su función su plugin de Hub Spot también pero aveces lo alenta. El código de rastreo lo pone por default y a veces se me olvida borrarlo es lo de menos pero sería mejor que te pregunte o se ponga con un click para facilitar cuando si se quiere rastrear un correo.,3 of 5,Jun 5 2021

En general la aplicación funciona y lo hace de manera adecuada. La integración es sencilla sin llegar a ser espectacular porque te obliga a utilizar HubSpot para interactuar es decir si mandas el correo directo desde outlook no tiene el mismo tratamiento. Lo que definitivamente no me agradó y es por lo que dejé de utilizarlo es porque no permite agregar un buzón de cuenta personal solo general y así cualquiera puede ver todos los correos.,4 of 5,May 31 2021

HubSpot ADD IN FOR OUTLOOK NOT WORKING HubSpot’s Add in extensions slow up Outlook performance - not sure if this is an Outlook or HubSpot issue. Currently HubSpot add ins not working with Outlook at all it’s a known issue with Microsoft and HubSpot. Both HubSpot and Microsoft have opportunity to improve native integration. MICROSOFT TEAMS HubSpot still to this date only supports zoom. Not able to use Microsoft Teams for virtual meetings and meeting invite - is a massive downfall. If and when it’s available will make a massive difference to existing and new HubSpot users!,1 of 5,May 28 2021

It is helping us to keep track of what we've said to who and how often. I wish it was a bit more intelligent - focused just on the one account that I have in my outlook not my personal account too. I also wish I understood a bit more about how it picks up what to track. But generally considering we've only been using it in our business for last couple of weeks we're finding it helpful.,3 of 5,May 24 2021

I have 12 members of staff most of which have now given up with the integration. It kills Outlook performance end up missing characters when typing the BCC wont clear unless you delete it several times ! As the Add-In refreshes it causes Outlook to pause.

One of the worst plug ins ever not compatible and thus when Outlook updates HubSpot stops working,1 of 5,Dec 16 2020

Outlook is great. HubSpot plugged into Outlook doesnt work. I have to use Outlook in Edge for it to work correctly. I reported a ticket some time ago and was told this was not a HubSpot issue it was a problem with Microsoft Outlook. Many new versions of Outlook have been released and it still doesnt work. When replying to an email and adding tracking too it the formatting of the email gets subtly changed and when viewed by the receiving party using Outlook on Windows comes up with a contacting server loading message.,1 of 5,Dec 16 2020

Outlook me ha servido bien. La integración con HubSpot no fue de las mejores en el calendario pues como uso Google calendar debí configurar extra para que se reflejaran las reuniones y actividades.

Outlook is great the HubSpot addition is awesome but when it is pinned and you are typing it takes a very long time for the letters to catch up it slows down the system when the extension is in use,2 of 5,Dec 10 2020

There is one feature that is available in Gmail that is not in Outlook. That is the ability to go to an email thread by following a link in the HubSpot activity feed in the same way as you can for Gmail. If I get a notification that 'someone' opened an email I have to search in Outlook to find out who that might be based on the email subject. With the Gmail integration you just click a link and are taken to the email. Also it is not very stable. The add-in crashes from time to time and fails to track. If you don't spot this you are sending emails that are not tracked which is not great. If you do spot it you have to restart Outlook to fix.,3 of 5,Dec 10 2020

My email signature doesn't send out whenever I email from HubSpot. And now I'm going to keep typing until I reach the character count. Okay I've passed over it now. How's your day going? Why don't I ever get paid for my ideas? Should I start a consulting firm?,3 of 5,Dec 10 2020

As an independent sales person trying to understand how to use this integration has been such a pain in the neck. Not to mention the countless wasted hours reading through so much crap that does not help a non technical person solve an issue.,2 of 5,Oct 23 2020
