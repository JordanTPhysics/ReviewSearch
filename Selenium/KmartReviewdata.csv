1,2021-11-30 22:54:00,Went to your store at Whitfords. Only had 2 items. I do not go through the self service in any store so waited patiently for the only person at a checkout. I have never seen anyone so slow there was only one person before me. Changed staff whilst serving these ladies. In the meantime my husband who was waiting outside was thinking of sending in a search party for me. I was nearly ready to leave my purchases and walk out! I may be wrong but it seemed like it was deliberately slow so we would move to self service. Have decided not to go to that store again or any other of your stores if you do not provide a checkout other than self serve.,neg,Kmart

As the cashier was scanning my items I noticed one item that was a different price from what I saw on the shelf, so I told her about it and she just looked at me like she didn't care, so I told her what are you gonna do about it, she just keep putting my items into the bag, I then said aren't you gonna check it? Didn't respond so I then asked her if she wanted me to go back and take a picture of the price and she said yes, so I went and took a picture myself which I know they're suppose to go and check the price themselves. So I went back to she her my phone she then told me I needed to go to customer service, I stood there and said but there's NO ONE there, so finally someone came to the counter so I told her what happened, she said I that she needs to go and check the price, I told her that the cashier told me to go and take a picture so I was telling her I had a picture of it on my phone, but she said she had to check herself,when she came back she told me that it was for another item, I then told her why was it placed on the shelf she said I don't know, so she then called for the supervisor cashier which was MY SAME CASHIER that didn't know how to scan my shop your way card?? &#9792;&#65039;. So the cashier said she wasn't gonna make any price adjustment, so I asked them what are they gonna do about it, the customer service representative called for the stocker to fix it.

It was on 10/17/19 that I finally opened a tube for use & found contents completely dry. Brought back both opened & unopened pkgs, and was told since return was over 30 days (3 days tardy mind you) store policy gave me no choice but to get replacement mascaras. I expressed not wanting to risk getting another dried out mascara. Kmart's cosmetic dept is clearly NOT being restocked, and I asked cashier if I could get merchandise credit due to circumstances of inferior product. Was told no, but she agreed to allow me to pick out other types of cosmetics to total the $20 since I could not get my money back. Found Kmart's cosmetic shelves a mess & nearly empty, and what was left was picked over with items found opened or broken. After quite some time, I gathered some decent items; and after being rung up back at Customer Service, cashier informed me I had approx only $8.00 worth of items. Went back & rummaged again thru pitiful stock, wasting huge amount of my time. On my 2nd return to Customer Service desk, still was under value of my $20.00. I gave up at that point, and just settled. Did not want to go back to Cosmetics a third time. Cashier charged me for 2 items under $5.00 my husband chose because they weren't ""cosmetics"" and could not be included in my $20 replacement items.

On April 14, 2019 we shopped at Kmart store 7246
Address 3150National Road West Richmond, Indiana phone # 765-966-2561
Receipt 07246 041419 004 99226 at 5:47PM (7246 04 9922 0060) cashier Ashley
Sorry for all the info but I do not know how far we need to go to get our money back.

On this receipt are 2 steam cards at 50.00 each. Both cards stated on receipt that they failed
Card one 07675006869 card account #6484 states on receipt FAILED
Card two 07675006869 card account #9312 states on receipt FAILED

These were purchased for our grandsons Birthday so was not tried till later. When my wife saw the cards failed she questioned the clerk and asks her to re-ring them which she refused to do stating they were fixed and perfectly fine. When my grandson tried to use the cards, it did not work. He called my son, he tried with same results. We ran a total of the bill and the cards were a part of the total purchase.
Today 5/24/19 we drove from Rushville In to Richmond with cards and receipt.
The clerk said there was nothing he could do so we ask to talk to a manager. She looked and said it should have not been included as a cost. She also reran the receipt and acknowledged the two steam cards had been charged on the receipt.
Now we figured this should be a simple process but manager said she could not refund money and we would have to come back with the Discover statement showing the charge for the two cards.
I contacted Discover and they said they could fax a copy but was told by Kmart manager that they did not have a fax number and we would have to come back with the statement from Discover so they could send the info to corporate. We asked if we brought it back tonight, could we get a start of getting this resolved but was told no manager would be on duty to help us.
I believe we are getting the run around and I am very upset with how this is playing out so to anyone who still uses Kmart, be for warned, they do not take customer service seriously.

We returned to the store which is about a 20 mile round trip. The customer Service person could not make a decision, she had to call someone else that looked at us like we were trying to rip them off. They hesitated in deciding to do anything. We asked if we could just exchange it for the correct one. They hesitantly agreed. On searching they did not have the one we need. So now there is nothing they can do. We live on Social Security, my husband is 100% disabled Veteran. 34.99 regular price plus tax is a lot of money. Plus the gas to go back and forth. One of the Security guys at the door suggested we come back the next day and talk to the store Manager Susane, We did that this morning. What a joke that was. Yesterday I felt like I was being ripped off. Today I am sure I was ripped off. All I want was my money back on a cartridge I paid full price for. What if it was defective??? We would be out in the cold just like we are today. We have shopped Kmart stores for over 50 years and you show this amount of concern for your regular customers. No wonder you are closing stores.

139,2017-12-27 15:11:00,"Kmart and Shop Your Way stores have great holiday deals, and I've placed orders with them for years, without significant issue. Unfortunately, this year was very different. I placed several orders, and have had to reach out to customer service, multiple times. The following, being the worst of these experiences, and the final straw for me. I won't be ordering from them again, and will take my business elsewhere.

I placed an online order on 12/18 for 10 Trim Your Home Thermal Travel Mugs that were on sale, and supposedly available for pick up, at my local store. The amount of the purchase was placed in a pending status on my account. On 12/19, I received two e-mails from Kmart. The first email indicated that some of the ordered items were out of stock. The second email indicated that the ordered items were available for pick up, however, the listed mug styles and quantities did not match the original order, and did not reflect the out of stock items. I logged into my account to try and figure it out, but the order status was 'ready for pickup' and I did not see any changes for out of stock items. So, I initiated a chat session with customer service to obtain clarification for item availability and cost. The representative confirmed items were out of stock, but could not explain the quantity/style/ cost discrepancies. I was told I could pick up available items, at the store, and that my account would be credited for out of stock items. However, I still did not have clarification on what was available, and how much my account would be charged. After several exchanges, the representative still could not confirm, so I asked them to cancel the order, remove the pending charge, and requested a transcript of the conversation via e-mail (which I never received).
On 12/20, I received an order cancellation e-mail, but it was for the wrong order. They cancelled an earlier order that had already been paid for, and picked up, and credited my account an amount, was less than what I paid for that order.
And my account was also charged for the 12/18 order. What the heck? Decided on 12/21, that would be best to contact customer service by phone, to straighten out the issue. Spoke with Ken, explained everything, and gave him the order numbers. He researched the issue, said that he would get everything corrected, and that I would receive an e-mail update within 24-72hrs that would include my refund information. Thought we were on the right track, until I received another e-mail from Kmart, on 12/26, that my order was ready for pick up. The update e-mail, regarding my refund, was never received. My family left today, so I reached out to Kmart customer service again, via phone. This time I spoke with Ann, explained the issue, and voiced my displeasure about whole situation. She was nice, but basically said the same thing that Ken had told me, and said that I would receive an e-mail by the end of the day regarding my cancellation and refund. She also said that the amount wouldn't be credited to my account for at least another 3-5 business days after I received the e-mail. I didn't like this answer, and asked to speak with her manager. She was reluctant to let me speak with a manager, but finally agreed, and put me on hold. When she came back, she said the manager was busy, and that the actions she was taking would be the best solution. When I balked at this, she said I could leave my number and the manager would call me back at some point, but she could not give me a timeframe. What the heck? I said forget it, and hung up. Not only did Kmart charge me for merchandise I have not received, but they can't seem to figure out how to refund my money. It's inexcusable and horrid customer service. Buyers Beware",neg,Kmart

The pharmacist, William, at your Morehead City location, has repeatedly ignored me, my Dr.'s refill transmittals resulting in a lapse of my medications at times,and claimed that he has submitted requests to my rheumatologist, when in fact he didn't. This can be confirmed by my rheumatologist. In November when I went to pick up my medication he looked ""everywhere"" then said he was out of stock and it would be 4 more days. I asked for the prescription back to take elsewhere and he stated, "" I have to go to the bathroom so you will have to wait"". Puzzled he couldnt just give it to me prior to his restroom trip and incredulous at his lack of professionalism, I browsed the area aisles within view of the pharmacy. After 10-15 minutes he returned and as I approached the counter he reaches for a bag with my prescription inside. He stated he was mistaken. There was no possibility of him filling it after his restroom trip as I was present. The prescription was not in the bin, it was by the register before he took his break.
I noticed the date and he had filled it that very day. I am in very poor health and several times prior I have gone to pick up my medications and waited in line for several minutes while he chatted with customers about things OTHER than their medications. I once had to sit at the blood pressure chair so long I finally just left. My reason for this complaint doesn't come lightly. I thought long and hard about this not wanting to damage a career. Never once has he been congenial though I have witnessed his congeniality on several occasions with other customers.Today I wanted to pick up a prescription as it is Christmas and I am leaving town for Alabama tomorrow at 6am and the other pharmacist initials JLH said I couldn't pick it up until Christmas Eve. It was filled on the 25th of last month. That makes it EXACTLY 30 days since the prior refill. Call me crazy but it seems in light of the Christmas holidays I could pick it up 2 days earlier than my running out.",neg,Kmart

Any way I asked her to check for me she said I don't have the buy one get one free I ask why I don't the sign said buy one get one free I said where the problem I was totally socked when she said that I have a shirt for 16.98 instead of 16.99 I said what you mean tell me 1 cent difference is why I can't get the shirt. She said yes they have to be 16.99 in order to get the buy one get one free. Kmart should be ashamed putting out a sale like that. I told her put it back I was not going to go back and reshoppe for a penny. That bad business for a penny. And then she told me I got read fine print on sign. Who got time read fine print when you shopping. Don't try to fool our intelligence like that. If you gone do sale do it don't play games. Make me think twice about shopping there.",neg,Kmart

When I called they said that sometimes your items will be cancelled if it gets back to the warehouse and they're out of that item. I asked if that was disclosed somewhere when I ordered this and was told it is not. So had I known that what I order is a luck of the draw on wether or not I receive my item I would of ordered from somewhere else!!! I now have to wait to be refunded 4-7 BUSINESS DAYS and have to then order this item, pay more because now the sale on this item at Target is not available and wait another week to get this item. I have never had this issue with a store and doing online ordering. Then when I ask for someone other then customer service to call me back I get told that I will get a email.

I will be letting any and everyone know that this is the service I received. I've been a loyal customer to both Kmart and Sears and now I don't think I will ever do business with you again.

She was so unprofessional and rude! She expected me to wait again in a line for something that clearly was not my mistake! I was charged for an item that I did not have due to an error on the cashiers part and was treated like I was the one that made the error! She kept repeating to go in back of line! ! She was just standing there doing nothing! So I asked the cashier to give me the item she charged me for, being that I paid for it and walked out of store!

I was completely frustrated and annoyed with the customer service register lady (vanessa) on Dec. 2, 2017 @ 7 pm. I stood in the same spot in line #6 for over 25 minutes, approached the customer service desk and asked the lady if she could ring me up, she stated that she was taking the next person in line, I explained that I was the next person in line and pointed to the line I was in, she stated she was taking the next person in line of her choice. I explained that due to the length of time I had been standing in the same place I technically was the next in line in the entire store. She continued to repeat herself saying, ""I'm taking the next in this line."" Due to frustration my tone became assertive, she then told me not to yell at her, I explained that I was not yelling and asked to speak to the manager. As I was telling the soft spoken male manager the situation she attempted to talk over me stating, ""I'm taking the next person in line."" I explained to the manager and lady again that I was the next in line. He was able to open another register and took me immediately. Honestly had it not been for the fact that I promised my toddler a toy for her patience in line I would have left my full cart the minute she refused to ring my items up. I really hope this person is addressed and trained on her customer service skills properly before you guys put her back in any positions dealing with customers.",neg,Kmart

Yesterday my child and I attempted to put the tree up to our surprise it came without a tree stand. So today my husband and I took the tree back to Kmart and attempted to exchange it for another one because my husband did not save the receipt and is not a ""rewards member"" our exchange was denied. I have been a loyal Kmart customer for over 20 years. We weren't asking for anything other than what was owed to us, you sold us a defective item. We didn't want cash or store credit. We wanted another tree to put up for Christmas for our kids. Our money was happily taken without issue, I don't understand why we could do an even exchange or exchange for another tree. Since when are customers treated as though they are not paying customers?? How can this issue be rectified? All we want is another tree for Christmas. I don't feel as though I should have to eat the cost of $100 tree: I've spoke to manufacturers of the tree company and a stand would not arrive in time for Christmas. We've always traveled to two Walmart's and you're Kmart in search of a replacement tree stand, since the tree has a lighting system it's not compatible with replacement stands.

However, Saturday evening I witnessed something quite rude and disrespectful from one of your managers. She was called up front to handle a situation from a teenage girl and her mother. I had just walked in and witnessed everything. Apparently, there was a misticketed product marked in correctly and the teenage girl was upset and asked for a refund. YOUR MANAGER NAMED SUSAN told that poor girl to learn to read and review things before you pay because there are signs throughout the store saying no refund and final. That was unnecessary to say that. The mother of the child grew angry when this was said and words werw exchanged between both. The girl and her mother eventually left livid. I overheard the manager call that child and her mother some vile words even though they had left the building. She also said something of the nature that she couldn't wait to shut this d*** building down cause she was tired of this s*** and d*** fools like them. I grew horrified and left because I was with my child. That was not the way to handle that situation and praise GOD that he is allowing that atmosphere and building to shut. Negative demons like that are not worth my money. I believe EVERYTHING happens for a reason and this atmosphere will not be good for anything. I hope Susan never works in the public eye again!!!

I told her please I only expect a working tree. She said absolutely NOT! So I thought caught her on a bad day let me call back and ask for a manager well that was worse! The man said No way will I exchange I told him it was still sealed brand new I never thought to check it. It doesn't light. He short with me and said nothing I can do.

I made payments as scheduled at the customer service desk as the layaway dept was NEVER open to do so. I had all my receipts stapled together and always handed the batch to the representitive when paying. On the day I wanted to pick up my layaway, I was told it was returned to shelf due to non payment. I clearly had all the receipts that stated I paid my amounts due without issue. Unfortunately we discovered that your customer service rep, the person that should know what they are doing typed in the wrong account number so my payment went to another persons account. We had a floor manager come to rectify the situation, but was unable to do so. The store manager then came took the receipts and walked away. A few minutes later the floor manager returned with some stupid story about how they would refund this much, then this much, but I did not get the layaway fee hich was $5, not $1 and I was charged $10 for cancelation.

I had to do an even exchange (with receipt)for 3 items to a larger size-all 3 items identical other than size-same prices. Because the items were bought on sale the previous week (on Friday and I came back Tues) they wanted me to pay the difference of the sale for the exchange. I refused and was told thats the way it is. I had to wait 10 minutes for a manager, and with reluctancy, finally was able to leave the store with my EVEN exchange.

I don't shop at Kmart a lot due to their merchandise normally being too costly and the staff for the most part aren't very friendly. In this case however, an elderly friend of mine purchased to mini blinds, that measured 31"" and he was unaware that they were the wrong size until I came to put them on. He needed the 35"" so we got in the car, drove from Kealakekua to kona to JUST TRADE THEM, OR RETURN WHICH EVER, AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS PASSED 30 and they don't take returns under no circumstances after this point. So I asked the young lady what she exactly wanted the elderly man to do with two brand new blinds that don't fit anything he has? Her reply was "" I don't know what to tell you, but you can't leave me here."" You need to take them with you!"" All I have to say to this is WTF!! I've never heard of such a thing in my life.

I tried to exchange a pair of shoes I received as a gift from my daughter for a smaller size and was told I couldn't as I didn't have the receipt. I called my daughter and she drove 20 miles to Kmart and brought the receipt. The cashier took the receipt and told me to go ahead and get the size I needed. I couldn't find my size so I got another pair that was about $10 more and I would just pay the difference. The cashier then told me that they couldn't do the exchange as the original purchase was over 30 days. I asked to speak to the manager and was told the same. I will never shop there or any Kmart again and neither will my family. Thats probably why they are going OUT OF BUSINESS VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.,neg,Kmart

You CAN NOT return ANYTHING after 30 days, not even to get the same product for a different size, NOTHING. 30 days and thats it.

When no one would help me yesterday when I took the items into the store to just get store credit, and there was NO WAY around the 30 day rule, I did NOT even want to shop in the store at all. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with K-Mart. I got a Sears card last December and spent even more money at Sears & K-Mart since December, but after this, where I can't even get some store credit for my uncles clothes, that he JUST RECENTLY purchased, I'm not going to shop at Sears OR K-Mart anymore.

242,2017-06-14 06:56:00,"Wow, stumbled onto this thread while searching ""how to get around Kmart's return policy."" I could not believe I was unable to return a pair of shoes I recently purchased in April. I had my receipt, the shoes had never been worn, the tags still on, and it's still current. They are STILL selling these shoes. But it was over 30 days. I had no idea that Kmart had a 30 day return policy. I shop everywhere, Target, Walmart, Macy's, Kohls...and I know of no other retailer, where I shop that has a 30 DAY return policy, maybe a local specialty shop, but not a big box retailer. No wonder they are closing stores all over. Good luck Kmart, I'll never spend another dime in your stores.",neg,Kmart
243,2017-06-13 12:46:00,"I just left KMART, Clearlake Avenue, Springfield, IL.

31 days ago, I purchased some seasonal-outdoor pillows for patio. A long time ago Kmarts store policy used to be you had to wait a large amount of days for a return with a check (14 I think). I thought it was now changed to 30 days for return on purchase with check. The receipt is not completely clear, and it does NOT read 30 days on ALL purchases. It does read, on SOME purchases. I asked the Kmart Store Clerk-when I was checking out with the pillows, ""do I have to wait 30 days for return?"", and she responded, ""YES"". Possibly she only heard the words, 30 days, and return??? I have been driving around for 30 days waiting to make my return. The pillows in bags, with TAGS on them, and RECEIPT. It was 31 days today-and the manager at the store said I could receive nothing, ""no refund, no gift card, nothing"". These are SEASONAL items-purchased from the SEASONAL section of store. I have been a regular customer at Kmart on Clearlake Avenue, Springfield, Illinois for over 40 years. I asked the Manager to call the Corporate Office-while I was there. He did, and we were transferred 3 times-to people that could barely speak English. He nor I could understand them. I was at the store for 40 minutes. I left with the 'seasonal pillows', and no refund, and nowhere to use or put these pillows. As they did not match, and I have already purchased others that do. If I had purchased these pillows at any other store in Springfield-I'm certain this would not have happened. I was less than 24 hours of Kmart's deadline-according to 'store policy', and I felt humiliated. If I do not get my money back, I will not ever enter another Kmart store again.",neg,Kmart

I didn't have a receipt and understand the policy.However, it was the worst customer service I had ever encountered.The associate was very rude and rolled their eyes at me when I asked a question. When I asked for the manager which were in different colored shirts,they were even ruder than the associate. They actually rolled their eyes also.To top it off, I had to carry my granddaughter out while my two pregnant daughters had to struggle to get the car seat back to the car.I will never shop there again and will definitely tell everyone I know to never shop there.

247,2017-06-07 00:21:00,"Before i narrate the horrible experience i had at kmart store in crofton md, i would like to email the ceo of this company to let him know the demeaning and low down, disrespectful and abusive customer service i received from one of his evening managers named kenya at the crofton store. I went to do an exchange for clothing i had received as a gift for my sons bday which was too little on him. She told me she cdnt process my exchange because i had no receipt, i told her i drove very far to get to this nearest kmart and pleaded with her to assist me, mind u i was with my baby who was crying as we had been there for over an hour trying to convince this lady to help me. She even went as far to tell me i can camp outside if i want, she wdnt help me. I contacted cust serv over the phone, they pulled the receipt emailed me a copy and told this manager to process the return for me, she proceeded by arguing with the customer service representative over the phone and telling him, her system was not allowing her to do the exchange even with a receipt, the customer service rep proceeded to tell me to come back the next day for the store manager to process the return as this evening manager named kenya was unwilling to help. At this point we had been in the store close to 2 hours, my baby was crying and i was distraught, never had i been mentally and emotionally abused by a store representative over an exchange of baby clothes. I almost contacted a lawyer to file a lawsuit for emotional abuse but didn't because it was at night. No employee should be given such power to mistreat customers, regardless of who they are. As a big name dept store you should be aware of who is representing you and how they are representing your business, yes you may not have enough employees however it still doesnt justify horrible customer service.

There was a newish lady on the register and another agitated customer who couldn't get the right price scanned on the register. She called an a senior clerk to help her and after a long delay he showed up to help her with the transaction. He wanted to but several bags of mulch which was pricing too high on the scanner vs the sign outside. In a hurried state the lady clerk took my cash for my small order and almost gave the agitated dud my change. I left the area and as I was leaving with my car from the lot the senior clerk ran out and shouted for me to stop. He asked if I picked up a check book and I looked at my wallet and told him no and that I paid cash. He said ""I had to ask"" and as I was leaving K mart on the way to my condo I realized he profiled me and thought I ran off with the agitated dud's checkbook which he probably found on his possecesion . First of all the company should not push inexperienced clerks into the garden and use it as a dungeon. Secondly being an Asian American and a health professional with a doctorate degree found this situation amusing and irritating.

The technician then stated that that was a waste of time. The young lady told him that was not appropriate as this elderly person had the right to ask these questions.

289,2017-03-16 16:39:00,"I am very frustrated and disappointed with your Covington, GA store.



I was in your store last night.

1st I picked up prescriptions in your pharmacy.



Coupons printed out Ã¢â?¬â?? for gas discount - one for

$9 off $60 ore more -$l2 for spending a higher amt.



Also a coupon that said $7 off $7 in Apparel Ã¢â?¬â?? that the coupon was good from 3-l5-17 to a future date.

It was 3/l5/l7 I was there.



I bought different clothes over $60 and used the $9 off coupon.

That was one transaction.



Next purchase I bought $l6 in panties and gave the cashier my $7 off $7 coupon Ã¢â?¬â?? she was having a problem an called a guy over Ã¢â?¬â?? maybe her supervisor? CashierÃ¢â?¬â?¢s name was shenia on my receipt.



I used my phone # for my account info. For cashier Ã¢â?¬â?? 770*728-9596



The cashier, Shenia and guy called over agreed it was a valid Kmart coupon Ã¢â?¬â?? indate -and I did purchase the apparel it was good on - $7 off $7 apparel



When I got home and looked at the receipt later that night I saw she did NOT take off $7 Kmart coupon..



She did NOT say she was not taking it off and give it back to me to try on something.

She just acted like she did take it off Ã¢â?¬Â¦ I feel tricked.



I bought the apparel to use the coupon.



My daughter (2l) to the receipt back to the Kmart store today and discussed it. They said too bad Ã¢â?¬â?? they would not do anything.



I asked for them to get the store manager and let me speak to her.



The store manager came Ã¢â?¬â?? wrote her name on the receipt Rooknit? And REFUSED to speak to me on the phone. My daughter was trying to hand her the cell phone because I wanted to know why they tricked me Ã¢â?¬â?? making me think sure Ã¢â?¬â?? it was fine Ã¢â?¬â?? they would deduct it Ã¢â?¬â?? Not even give my $7 off $7 back to try on anything else.



Do you train your managers to refuse to talk to a customer on the phone who feels very upset/frustrated/ripped off?



My name is Donna Abbott Ã¢â?¬â?? I was there",neg,Kmart

Anyways, I went in filled up a cart with a bunch of home stuff, ironing board, towels and a new shirt. Go to customer services to return/exchange the shirts and purchase my cart of items. Lady tells me I cannot return or exchange the shirts so I ask for a manager who then comes and aggressively points to the ""30 return policy"" and says there is nothing he can so. Basically I'm SOL and stuck with the shirts. So i ask you would rather me walk away right now from giving you money for all these items and lose a customer for life than just do the exchange. (Also these shirts are still on the shelves, tons of them). He could care less about losing a sale and a customer. I took my two shirts and promptly left the store and left them with a counter full of stuff and an ironing board to put away. Crap service.

There are so many in my age bracket, where we are left behind with new tech. But its good and a peace of mind where the young today assist in a proffessional manner with excellent customer service as this young staff member displayed. I will definitely be returning to his department and he will be talked about in my home and my job. This young lad does not know what l do for a living.

I have had 400-600-800-1000 thread count sheets and have sent them back. So I was skeptical when I saw this. I ordered them for store pick up, but they gave me the pillow cases for this price. I showed them the ad online and they refunded my money. It was on Saturday and they were very busy, so I came home, called the store and asked them if I could get the sheets for the price advertised online. I was told they did not have them in stock but the store manager Rose, would go to another store and get them for me and have them on Sunday. Delivered as promised.

The other stores did not stock the model I wanted. The customer service flock at those stores could not order for me. In fact, in one store after waiting for service for a long time, and I was the only person at the counter, a lady came from the back. I asked her to please order the item and handed her all the printed information. Another long wait, while a sparse line was forming, she returned advising she could not order the item.

I must say that I have had rough times at this store with the cashiers and even some costumer service employees, but I've seen positive changes around. The other day I was trying to find a comforter and a sweet lady came to help me. With her kindness and good costumer service skills I bought not only the comforter, but curtains, pillows and even rugs to match it. She even gave me her work schedule for whenever I needed assistance I would be able to call her. Her name is Raquel and definitely, Kmart needs more people like her.",pos,Kmart

460,2013-01-14 15:25:00,"On Sunday, 01/13/13 I went into store #4341 to pick up a few articles that were being held for me from the evening before. After getting the items I proceeded to be checked out. It was at this time that I can say that I received the BEST Cashier customer service that I have ever received. While the cashiers and managers are ALWAYS courteous at this store I have never had the experience of a cashier being as helpful as the associate who assisted me at this visit. I usually don't pay much attention to the coupons that come out with my receipts I just take them and keep moving and subsequently throw them away. But on 01/13/13, after ringing up my initial sale and giving me my receipt and coupons (which are usually just trashed) Sales Associate ""SANDRA BATISTE"" at STORE #4341 took the time to tell me to look at my coupons as I may have some savings on other items I might need. Well needless to say that upon finally taking the time to look at the coupons there were at least 3 that were of value to me that I was able to take advantage of on that date for items needed, but would not have necessarily been purchased on that date without the advantage of the coupons, so not only did I purchase the items being held that I initially went in for, but because of SANDRA taking the time to bring the coupons to my attention I spent more money than initially anticipated. I don't know about you but for me, any sales associate who displays the expertise to encourage a customer to add on sales and bring more money into your store is certainly one of value. She further brought to my attention that I had coupons that would be effective on 01/14/13. In addition to her service to me, as my sales, discounts etc were taking time, SANDRA told me to take my time figuring out my new purchases & coupons, did what she had to do to stop the transactions on my sales, opened another register, assisted all of the people who were in line behind me and then came back and completed her service with me. She did not refer those in line to another cashier, it was like all of those who were in HER line were HER personal customers and she would assist them & not put her work on anyone else. Wow, both my daughter-in-law and I were in Awe. I am 70 yrs old and I am a shopper. I shop everywhere from Macy's to the dollar store down to thrift shops but I have NEVER seen this type of customer care service by an associate. Please extend my sincere Thanks and appreciation to SANDRA BATISTE and whatever recognition or rewards that K-mart extends to their employees for Outstanding Customer Service should most definitely be extended to Sandra. If I were an ""Under Cover Boss"" Sandra would have definitely been an employee rewarded for a customer service job ""Well done."" Thank you for the opportunity to share her service with you and others.",pos,Kmart

The rows and shelves are so close to togehter it makes it almost impossible to manuaver the chair between them. Some aisles i can't even get into. I acciently hit one of the clothing racks trying to get out in the main aisle and turned it over. A Kmart employee was near by and made a very rude comment and not offering me help which she could obiliously see i needed help. Tractor Trailers are parking the Kmart lot. 5 or 6 at time a lot of times. The truckers are visited by whores from a cheap hotel across the street. I have seen this multiple time as has several other of my friends. This was a great Kmart until all this low life started coming around the parking lot. I have reported this to the manager multiple times and she said there is nothing they can do. I call the police and they are aware of it and cannot get Kmart to do anything, If these low lifes continue to park and do what ever i will take my business else where (i spend about $250 a month at Kmart) thanks.

Went to Kmart (store #7616) and was helped by a very nice employee by the name of Deborah Thompson.

474,2012-08-06 22:50:00,"I get my precriptions at Kmart in Rome, Ga.
They have had a couple turnover in the pharmacist postion. Bryon is still ther. After many fill in pharmacist and a couple full time that quit , there is a new girl there. She seems very knowledgeable and helpful but I have heard negative comments about her maily not being Bryon, but also about her not being friendly. Every time I go in there after 5 or 6 she is the only one there trying to answer all the phones, fill new prescriptions coming in that everyone wants to wait for, doing the automatic rxs AND running the register all by herself. She does a great job getting it done but it does take more time that could be saved by having a register person.
A lot of people come in to pick up after 5. I heard her ask for help and no one ever showed up . One rude custmer kept complaining about something the other pharmacist did but blamed the by her self pharmacist trying to ring her up.And another man saw that there were 5 people in line to be rang up but kept piling 30 boxes of candy up on the counter then wanted to borrow pills he knew he didnt have a refill on because he was going out of town. All the pharmacist said was that if he had called them in earlier, they probably could have gotten itok'd by the doctor. he said he was too busy.
So sometimes it's not the direct employee that is helping you, it's the lack of help the professional pharmacist has /or no help at all, that causes the delays . And if you are frustrated imagine how frustating it must by for the Pharmacist to try to do her work and the techs work and the register persons work all at the same time AND be new while every wants to talk to the one that has been there for 20 years. Get the pharmacy some help--I'm sure they are the ones keeping the store going. And shame on you customers for taking out your frustrations one the one person left to take care of everything and everyone. I think she is doing a great job

482,2012-07-11 12:22:00,I really enjoy local K mart but i can not believe how time have changed from employees having to get so many credit cards apps. Rewards cards or they get there hours cut or be replaced.I can go into local Kmart when there is a door greeter asking if you would like a rewards card of credit card.The check out the same but if there is not enough people signing up for this employees have to go up and down isles to ask shoppers for this again.Wow when is this enough ? I myself think the word no thanks should be enough no so if every time i go shopping there {this is a small store} So respect the shoppers who just want to go buy what they wish and not have to jump through hoops .Also if you use your rewards card you have to answer a survey to get check out .Cutting cost is something can understand but when dose this stop.You must have a email address or text to have a rewards card? OK elderly people may not have either so are they through under the bus because of this?I under stand it is not only Kmart but cut cost the person who sets at a desk thinking of these things well cut cost loose this person!,pos,Kmart

514,2011-12-28 14:41:00,"I LOVE my kmart store, and most of the time the line moves slow because people dont have their form of payment ready, or they are doing multiple transactions. if you watch around you in the line, you can see whats going on, i guess i pay attention because i used to be a cashier. plus if you wait to the last min to do christmas shopping the lines will be LONG, thats just common sense. if you want short lines go during hours when people sleep. ie after 8 pm. or go early when people are still sleeping like when they first open. then you wont have lines ! Kmart is the only store i know that gives cash back with their rewards card. that you dont have to spend $100's of dollars to get, its on every dollar you spend. That keeps me coming back, plus each time you check out, you get a coupon. i dont know where you are from but couponing is HUGE here where i am. we stretch every dollar we can.",pos,Kmart

I still shop your stores but I find yours stores in the Columbus GA area are really run down. The one thing I hate the most is waiting in long checkout lines. The Kmart's here have long lines during the day because they only have like one or two lanes open. Sometimes I need something qick and I head to Kmart but I turn around at the doors because the checkout lines are backed up because they only have one lane open.

Thx,

519,2011-12-20 17:09:00,"Hi my name is Anna Burke. I would like to put forward a compliment towards Kmart Mt isa and the wonderful service I have recieved. Honestly I have always had great service, from wonderful and truely caring people in the Mt Isa kmart service. However just before xmas there was a hitch with a xmas item and evern after serveral phone calls and walking the shop for 2 hrs, I came home empty handed.. Finally I spoke to the manager David, who moved the world to accomodate my need for a particular item, which wasn't easiy to find. I would personally like offically to thank him and all the staff of Mt Isa for giving me top class service. Over all I wish there management to acknowlege this professional and kind deed for this xmas period. It is also important to state, that i have seen many kmart stores in qld and not many are at the high standard of that of Mt Isa. I would hate to think if I move one day, to what I would do if there was not a kmart store to shop in! In all honesty, some times this may not work out the way the should, but my experience with this kmart store is if someone fails, there is always some one there to fix it all up for you. Basically most staff go the extra mile to accomodate your needs in our local store here in Mt Isa. I wish every one a Merry Xmas and a most Wonderful New Year. Kindest Regards Anna Burke.

523,2011-12-15 20:27:00,"My husband had purchased a GE digital camera for me from store #3858 on Baseline Road in Phoenix. I was excited to take pictures of my latest rescue animal and started using it immediately. Unforturnately, the camera's memory would be full after four pictures and erase them and would need to be reformatted constantly, etc., therefore, defective. We both attempted to figure out the issue multiple times, without luck. I finally deceided that there was no alternative but to return camera. As always, my husband had purchased warranty and I was confidant the process would be easy. Wrong. I was sent back and forth from Electronics to Customer Service to calling two different Customer Service numbers (I was told that store would just trade camera out, and was informed at the store that it needed to be handled by headquarters) back to Customer Service desk. Fortunately, Maria was working. She answered my questions, helped me contact Customer Service/Warranty department (which was a bit of a runaround) on the phone and I still had no straight answers. Seeing my frustration, Maria was very pleasant and professional and asked if I would like to speak with a manager. Assistant Manager John appeared within minutes. Extremely helpful and effecient, he resolved my issue within minutes and made my day. I am beyond happy and will remain a steadfast customer (boo Walmart). By the way, I am a nearly 17 year employee of a Fortune 500 company well known for excellent customer service.

When we got to the store they could not find our name in the system. After ten minutes of looking the cashier found it. She said all the items were put back on the shelf because of a late payment. As I took out my smart phone and added up the days we were not late. At this time my wife was very upset the line behind us was growing longer and the layaway dept was closing. A store manager was called (Joanne Grandits, store 4319) to assist us. She looked at everything and we told her that we had atleast one more day to make it to pay on the items. She was very professional. She simply gave us our refund and had the employees get all the items and redo the transaction over without taking the 15 dollar fee away.

If they want to go shop Wal-mart (Welfare mart) and brag about it, that's their own stupid mistake. Considering all the hell Kmart's been through since the bankruptcy and their limited payroll, I think they do an outstanding job at customer service with the associates they have, and their prices beat Wal-Mart's every time when it comes to sales.

Kmart is coming back - and Barbara, the rewards card is free and you get FREE MONEY TO SHOP AT KMART as well as not needing a receipt for a return if you have one, so... good job at not wanting one. I'm very pleased with the direction Kmart is going in, and whether it be Kmart or another retailer, I can't wait to see someone knock Wal-Mart off their high horse.


My local Kmart is always properly staffed, the store is always neat and above all else I have had no problems with customer service.

I told him about the sale. He told Cindy (Clock # 5006) to give me the 10% discount when I came in to pay off the refrig. She was very helpful and supportive about my complaint. I told Guy I would continue to shop there because of his good customer service. I have had trouble with Sears in the past. I was a loyal customer for 20 years with them. When they did not handle my situation with courtesy. I paid my credit card and returned it to them and said I would never buy anything from them again. I would tell my friends & family not to shop with them. I did not shop at Sears for 21 years. I thought I would give them another chance only to be disappointed by them again. I was happy Guy helped me with my complaint. Thank you! Guy & Cindy! A New Customer Renie Pedregon",pos,Kmart

575,2011-05-21 06:21:00,"During a trip to Williamsburg, Va, my wife and I went to Kmart( Store 7259 ) to get a fanny pack. We are from upstate New York but we travel to Virginia once a year for a vacation. It was on Saturday and the time was around 8:30 AM. We had to checkout at customer service and the clerk asked if we found everthing OK and we said no because of the fanny pack. She said she remembered seeing some the day before so she called sporting goods and between them, they finally found them in Luggage. The clerks name is Amber and I think she went above and beyond the way she took to find them for us. I think you could use more like her.
My name is Fred McBride and my e-mail is mmcbride002@rochester.rr.com. She should be given a raise or be commended on a good job done.",pos,Kmart

In Mothers Day of 2011,my husband and I went to pick up a prescription at the Kmart Pharmacy and we walked thourgh Patio Furniture. Ben and Keith couldnt be more helpfull. We found a Patio set that was mismarked by someone the night before at an extremly low price. Keith ( #17 ) at store 3237 made sure that although everyone knew it was a massive mistake it made the experince quite pleasant and tried not to make us feel quilty at all. He put his job on the line that day, to make sure he recieved kind and quality service. My hats off to the team at store 3237 for training thier employees to always be courtious and kind no matter what the circumstances. My mother worked for a Kmart store in Pa. for almost 20 years and that is the first place I always go when I have to shop, and that tradition will always stand.

So please make sure Keith and Ben get another star for their service.

Happy Patio customer.",pos,Kmart
