One end to plug in to our motor home when we are away to charge my pad , I am disappointed this cable wasn’t included as anyone knows ,apple product are not cheap , we phone the help line but really I guess the persons hands are tied to offer a lead for free so I did order one , but again disappointed when you spend so much money to have to spend more , not a good customer service would have been good if they could have sent the cable out for free as this cable came with my last mini I pad or give you a choice of cables when you order as did not need a 13 amp plug asUSB is the most popular type of connection."
07/01/2022,"My iPad is only three years old. Used for a couple of hours a week and charged/ cared for online with Apple recommendations. Excellent condition- so why, when I was forced to put the latest update on my charged and perfectly working iPad did it kill it?"
15/09/2021,"I was considering upgrading my elderly iPhone 6 so I fired up the Apple Store app. Only I’m blocked from using it until I install the latest version. I can’t install the latest version because it requires iOS 13. I can’t install iOS 14 because I have an iPhone 6. Okay, I think, I’ll have to use Safari to do it. But as soon as you start trying to compare phones it tries to launch the app instead. So I can’t use the website and I can’t use the app."
18/09/2021,You know I’m starting to think I want to have a new iPhone instead of my iPhone 7 so I looked on here and I didn’t notice that the brand new iPhone 13 came out so I just bought it. And I looked at the website and it said “28 hours of battery” and WHAT?! Until it came I just grabbed it and ripped the box off. Thank you for making the iPhone 13.
16/06/2020,This works wonders so much easier then having to type in safari and everything I want for all of my devices is right there on on homepage. If people have problems with two Apple ID’s why don’t you just have one in the first place. Apple makes life simple and easy which is all I ever want in a chaotic and stressful world. This app works flawlessly on my iPad and my iPhone.
15/05/2021,"There I was, thinking it was about time to upgrade my old iPhone. Off I trot, as I have before, to this Apple store app to check out the shiny new iPhones, only to find that it doesn’t work with my iPhone’s iOS (12) anymore, first I have to buy an iPhone with at least iOS 13 to use the App to buy a new iPhone. Catch 22. So, that’s a brilliant piece of Apple thinking - “I know, let’s make it harder for people with old Apple stuff to upgrade and spend money with us...”."
11/12/2021,"I found this app infuriating to use. Although signed in on iPhone, none of my details were saved. Manually inputting, name and address EVERY time is useless. The app seems fixated on an old postcode for delivery. Changing it, saving it, resaving it seems to solve the issue for seconds before it reverts back on the next visit. If you have a digital store card, good luck. It won’t save to the Apple Wallet (permanent error message); you can’t copy and paste the PIN, so either print it out or do PIN tennis from store app to email app - awful."
20/01/2021,I decided to buy a newer iPad so went to the Apple store app only to see a message saying there is a newer version and directing me to update. I clicked to do this and it took me to the iPad settings to update the iOS. This went through ok to iOS 12.5.1. All good. Tried again. No luck. Went to the Apple store app on the App Store and tried to update from there. This then said to update the app I need iOS 13 or later! So I want to buy a new iPad but Apple are denying me access to the Apple store because I have an older iPad. Tried the App support but there is no link in there that matches my problem.
15/03/2021,I have an old iPad with the latest software update on it. I now cannot access the apple store through the app as you need version 13 software or later what a joke.
26/01/2021,"Ive ordered a new ipad, keyboard and apple pen for my daughter school work. At the delivery section they’ve asked me to choose delivery time and date. So I’ve paid extra for next available day for delivery before noon."
