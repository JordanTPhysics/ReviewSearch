5,9/21/21 9:40AM,I ordered a MF644 printer directly from Canon - figured it would be more timely than a third party. WRONG! After they charged me 749.00 for printer and ink - they send me 300 worth of ink with no printer and offer no time frame for their backordered printer. I asked what they could do - the response was nothing but I could pay to send the ink back and they would refund when they receive in 10 to 20 days - it shouldn't cost a consumer money and time to do business with a company.

It does not deliver as expected, especially at that price point.On plain printing paper be prepared to see dull greys instead of black and washed out colours with little saturation. Same with premium quality paper. Same after running the auto print head cleaning function and the print head alignment function. This is after a few uses. I have had this printer for two months. In speaking to a Canon customer service Tech guy I was told that regardless of the clearly stated description on the package that advertised the fact that this printer is compatible with Apple IOS devices that is the expected quality of printing using Apple devices. I went through almost all of my cartridge ink trying to print on different settings to discover that on plain printing paper the only setting that delivers true Blacks and Saturated Colours is the Photo II setting on plain paper. All very well and good except that on the Photo II setting to get the Printing quality you paid for you will find yourself running out of ink Quickly. Good for Canon Cartridge Sales.",neg

I don't think that this is a case of ""operator error"" Cannon seriously screwed up the driver download and install process.

In the second repair attempt, they made the problem even worse, and I had to leave the lens with them for a third repair. Now, after another 2 of waiting, they're saying I have to wait for another 3 weeks just for new parts to arrive. They have already had the lens for over 5 weeks! I contacted Canon directly 2.5 weeks ago about the problem and since then have called and emailed them another 5-7 times, but no one has ever responded to me.

17,7/2/21 3:18PM,"I purchased a Canon Pixma TR4520 printer. I have not opened the box for a long time. When I finally started setting it up but I had difficulty placing the cartridges. In the meantime the printer sipped from my hands and fell. I tried a few times to insert the cartridges and then called Canon for advice. I had several exchanges on the phone and also via email and finally a technical support person told me that he had to do a test and decide on what to do next. He did his test with my help and determined that there was a problem with the printer and the fact that I was unable to insert the cartridges was because of the printer's dysfunctionality. I thought that the printer was damaged even tough it about 25 cm. height where it slipped from to the to the floor. He told me that Canon would send a replacement printer soon as I respond to his email message. He also took all the information about my name , address, printer's serial number, my buzzard no, etc. When I did not receive his email message, I contacted the company again and spoke to another representative who found all the records and asked me to respond to the same questions as the previous representative collected when I receive her email message. I sent the information, but she said she was unable to find the serial number. I requested that she escalate this matter to a higher level as I did not know what that meant and was unable to understand its implications. When I received a contact two day after, the person told me that he was asked by his supervisor hat the replacement printer would not be sent as the printer was dropped and the warranty did not cover this. I explained to the person that we have been having exchanges for the last three months for this issue and I was advised that the issue was not about the printer being dropped, I could not insert the cartridges as the printer was dysfunctional and that for the last two mounts I was assured that a replacement was to be sent to me promises and exchanges which were extremely time and energy consuming, the company decided to retract it s promise and left the customer in shock. It was truly unbelievable and I did not expect this from a company like CANON from which I purchased so many products and have held it in high regard. I would rate this experience zero.",neg

No phone number anywhere on their site to call. Their online suggestions and tech support are terrible -and create more problems than they solve. There are many comments online that their solution does not work, but Canon does not appear to be addressing them. They used to be so good - now it appears they just want to sell equipment and not deal with any issues like their scanner driver not working. Very frustrating experience. Be warned - the printer I bought a few years ago is great, but I may have to replace it as the scanner is constantly dropping out and Canon does not appear to be interested in fixing this issue.

I have never spoken with such a professional & knowledgeable person as this lady. I can not tell you how impressed I am with her professionalizum. I will quickly tell you that I had called a company that was representing themselves as a part of CANON! Seriously!!! They ended up talking me in to allowing them control of my computer. After talking to me about everything, (except what I called them for) concerning my Camon printer. they tried to sell me an anti virus system to the tune of almost $1k! I'm serious. Of course that was the premium package. The packages ranged from $299.00 & up. After about 30 minutes of being scared that someone over seas had all my confidential information...I finally decided to go into another room & call the 800 number provided on my Canon information sheet I received upon purchasing my printer. Chiquesia is the person who answered quickly & was my total savior from there on out. I quickly told her what this man was trying to do & asked her if she would speak with him. She was more than happy to help me. She was totally professional...& told him that they did not have a technical department in Atlanta GA where he had told me he was from!! Once he realized that she was not backing down & had all the right information he became rude & said he was going to hang up because I would not listen to him. Chiquesia saved the day!!! She was so amazing, professional & never raised her voice while putting this man in his place.

After that was over she explained in detail what to do so that would never happen again. She then said, ""now lets get that printer working for you again ma'am'! What a relief it is to get such great customer service. I was able to not only fix the issue I called in for...but after that was completed she asked me if there was anything else she could do for me before we finished the call? I remembered that I had tried many times to connect my fax machine. I asked her id she could help me & her kind reply was that she absolutely could walk me through the process of adding that feature. Bravo Chiquesia...with your expertise...I did it! Now I have access to a fax machine in my own home...so much better than taking everything somewhere else to have it done...plus paying for that service! I want you all to know that this lady is defiantly a added bonus to your company! Before we hung up I asked her if there was someone I could speak to so I could relay my positive experience to.

Memory card: 32GB, SanDisc, Class 10.



This camera was bought in US, now I am in India.

I took cannon to service center in India, they said USA warranty cannot be applied here.

Now they say PCB UNIT have to be replaced.



PCB UNIT defect and to be replace



Part Charges Rs.2518/-

Service Charge Rs.750/-

Service Tax Rs.105/-

Total Charges Rs.3373/-



I bought this for 99$ + tax.

I have not even took a single photo, it needs a service for 60$ (3373Rs + some other charge).

I can't afford so much for a repair, it is better to buy a new once than to use this repaired one (not canon again)




I contact both US and India support, both refused to help me.

They cant waive off the service charge.

They cant extend my warranty.

They cant even give discount for the repair.

Not one time did it even have a slight hickup. It was amaizing....the best printer I've ever owned!! Light years ahead of the same category printers of Hp and Brothers. After three years if had its first malfunction and then you 'so called genius IT people' figured it was possible to improve on perfection. WRONG!!!! You came out with the MX922, so inferior and full of bugs you should be ashamed at even stamping the Canon name on this inferior piece of junk.

Again, customer made excuses accusing the checker of poking a hole in the cartridge. NOT HAPPY WITH CANON or customer service TO SAY THE LEAST!",neg
137,10/28/15 10:12PM,"Dear all,



I am trying to raise a complaint concerning your distributor Noble Equipment Est.



On 31-Aug-2015, we awarded a PO for a Canon Plotter delivery and installation in our plant in Ruwais.

Expected PO completion was on 14-Sept-2015



Since 29-Sept-2015, we are continuously requesting from Noble and Canon the CICPA registration in order to be able to issue a Letter of Assistance for them, but today after 1.5 months,

they inform us that this license has been expired and at least 1-2 months are required for renewal.




They proposed (is this a kind of joke ?) to move the plotter our side our premises, to install it (connected with what systems ?) and re-move it back to Ruwais.



You clearly understand that we are very dissatisfied with this co-operation.



Please find alternative and professional ways to asap satisfy your customer.



We remain at your disposal for any further clarifications required.



Thank you in advance

Best Regards

You think they would ship the printer and back order the toner, but not them, they cancel the whole order. I have waited over 8 working days, the worst customer sales service. I wanted to support cannon because they use American customer service, but the last three number of there sales service and tech service number is 666. I would guess that is no accident. DON'T BUY DIRECT!",neg
139,9/8/15 8:52AM,"I bought a Canon PIXMA 2520 last week. Due to lack of time, I didn't set it up until today. It was pretty shocking and disheartening to find that there was no USB cable included. I wondered why Canon would offer a printer that cannot perform its primary function. That's odd. Yet the fact that this is not disclosed to the customer , at the time of purchase, is even more peculiar...
At this point, I was still quite optimistic and decided to call the customer service number and talk to Technical Support, since I only had on question. I waited for Technical Support for about 20 minutes and was disconnected, only to call back and get disconnected again. The first time I called back I thought it was a mistake that was an easy fix,but the operator( name escapes me right now) told me that you were experiencing high call volumes and It would be 20 minute wait. She also stated that there was no direct number to technical support or a supervisor, you know in case I was disconnected again. As a customer with a problem, I understood it as, "" I cannot do anything to help you, in case you are disconnected again, so just keep calling."" Well needless to say, I waited another 15 minutes and was disconnected again. Now, I am just confused. I did not understand what was going on, but I knew I had very little options. I could keep calling back and take my chances on getting disconnected or I could go it alone. I decided to try 3rd time. This time I spoke with an operator named Jennifer. We had a very bad connection and I could barely hear her. She told me that it was my connection because she could hear me. I thought that was a little rude and horribly stated. I asked her if I could talk to a supervisor, you know the same supervisor that was unavailable earlier. After waiting for another few minutes, a supervisor, named John, FROM TECHNICAL SUPPORT answered the phone. Even though he was really friendly, I felt quite INSULTED. I had been calling for almost an hour trying to speak to this exact person and department. Yet, when he picked up the phone and stated that he was a supervisor, not only did he really upset me his connection was CRYSTAL CLEAR. It made me feel like my business truly did not matter to Canon, and made me look like a complete idiot. Not only did I have to answer my own question, I waited an hour just to feel insulted and miscellaneous to you. More importantly is the principle behind things, I believed in Canon enough to buy their products only to feel like a moron for doing so; and to add insult to injury, I still cannot finish the setup because I don't have a USB cord. Oh well, I guess I could print out my invoices some other time.",neg

But soon after starting the process, the software crashed. Using the telephone contact for help, I was disappointed to encounter someone who was hostile from the outset, telling me that what had happened was impossible, that Canon could not possibly send a message, and said she didn't understand what I meant by software. There was no Canon software anywhere. She kept repeating this sort of mantra, and if I tried to ask a question, she told me to stop interrupting.
Eventually, she said that the problem was mechanical and I would have to take it to an approved site to be repaired, difficult as I have no transport.

I call customer service just in case. I spoke with Eric. He then tells me my order was in fact canceled. I asked how it could be canceled since I did not cancel it and my money was gone. He then said that a portion of the payment may have been charged already but it would be put back in my account. I told him that the full payment was taken and I did not cancel my order. He apologized like he wasn't sorry at all and made me feel like I was a waste of his time.
He told me the money would be put back into my account in the next few days and I could replace my order.
He could not tell me why my order was canceled. And told me to just wait and replace the order.

But here is where the problem occurs. The Canon WP-DC37 ONLY fits the SD1400IS. The camera they sent me to replace it not only doesn't fit my housing, but the model (Powershot ELPH 330 HS) does not even HAVE a Canon underwater housing availablefor sale. The WP-DC37 can't be returned as I've had it for over 30 days. I figured if I explained my unique situation to a customer service rep the Canon ""award-winning"" customer service rep would be able to give me a different model that does have an underwater housing available, and maybe even exchange the housing I have for the new one I now require. I was wrong. After speaking with three different reps I was told they do not exchange accessories under any circumstances. So I am now stuck with a $200 useless underwater housing and a $200 useless replacement camera with no underwater option.

157,5/11/15 10:10AM,"In 2008, in good faith, I bought a Canon printer (MP190). It has worked well and I have enjoyed using it. Recently it began telling me the ink absorbers were full. I took them out, cleaned them, and reinstalled them. The computer, at this point, wouldn't recognize the printer. I spent several hours troubleshooting, nothing worked. My son, who works on computers, spent several hours. Nothing worked. I called Canon customer service this morning. Where I was informed when the ink absorber pads are cleaned there is a special tool that pushes a special button to tell the printer to talk to the computer again and only Canon service centers are given this ""special too"" and how to use it. Also, since the printer is several years old none of their service center will service them and all the ""special tools"" have been thrown away. In other words ... Canon devised a way to take more money from it's customers by making a simple repair impossible for them to do and ... since they apparently don't expect their products to last ... can't even find the tool to do it, now. Since, I know their has to be one of those tools on the planet, I asked them to make the tools available and post a video on how to fix it. I was told unequivocally ""No."" I asked for the supervisor, she told me she'd give me a 10% discount on a new Canon printer. I told her I would never purchase another Canon product if this is how they treat their customers.

Installed software end of 2013 but printer refused to print- would not even activate- thought I had installed wrongly. Pressured for time and did not successfully finalise call to Cannon HelpDesk (in Philippines). No representation in Australia- suspicious already.



Mid 2014 tried again to make unit work - checked my install again and software operability- still no activation. Never successfully turned on- never printed a page, scanned a document, nothing.

Finally end of 2014 had time to follow issue- persevered with Phillipino HelpDesk. After multiple (6) calls got someone to listen to me- escalated to

John Vincent Gomez

Customer Service Representative

Customer Support

Canon Australia Pty Ltd

P: 13 13 83 | W: www.canon.com.au

Social: Facebook | Twitter | YouTube

who supposedly has escalated the complaint. I sent him copies of receipt to prove I had bought the product as requested.



I logged the complaint on 14 January- it's now 11 February- nearly a month- no further news, no resolution.



Situation is: only 1 year warranty so no warranty by time of claim. Further information is repair guy at local Cannon Centre advises scanner broken and unit will not activate until scanner replaced. This was the case in mid 2013 when I bought the unit from Dick Smith's, still the case at end 2013 when I first tried to make the unit work and remains the case today- the unit was never operable at time of purchase-` warranty or not.



My issues are 2 fold:

1. There is no one in Australia to talk to hence you, me the consumer finds it very difficult to place and follow a complaint- Cannon Australia have 'run away' with the money but are not prepared to represent the product themselves with Australian staff, instead you, me are farmed off to a Phillipino Help Desk who has to deal with the negative feedback undoubtedly for little money and heaps of responsibility. Interestingly enough, the retailer Dick Smith didn't want to know me either- they all but hung up on me.

2. The product was 'dead' when I bought it- regardless of warranty and the company Cannon are not responsible or accountable for it- they hide behind an overseas HelpDesk whilst the undoubtedly concentrate on selling further loads of products to Australians without having to be accountable or responsible for those. The $150 purchase price is not the issue- the real issue is that Cannon should stand behind the product they sell. Cannon clearly do not.



My conclusion- only deal with overseas companies who have both sales and technical assistance personnel in Australia. At least then you can actually confront the company that manufactured your faulty product and seek restitution or replacement.",neg

A local shop said that the ""pins"" in the camera's USB port were broken and sold me a memory-card reader, which I'd not been able to get working for several months so had simply been inserting the memory card directly into the PC USB port. Last night the PC wasn't recognizing images on the memory card, despite repeated attempts, which seemed to leave no options.

The first rep thought the problem was with the PC's internal card reader; it's a good thing I didn't take that advice as it would have entailed an $$$ session with my PC tech support, which would have been fruitless. I called Canon a few minutes after hanging up with rep #1 to ask an incidental question and was connected with rep #2, who was able to help me figure out that the memory-card reader just hadn't been seated precisely in the USB port of the PC. As soon as that was accomplished, all of the photos transferred fine, and, per above, this was my first successful use of the reader. Though it would have been ""more ideal"" if rep #1 had given the accurate diagnosis (a call about same issue a couple of months ago had not been helpful; that rep had suggested I upgrade my camera (!), the time spent on the phone with him wasn't wasted as it led to the solution from rep #2.

236,5/27/13 4:04AM,"Worst product I ever bought was a Canon E60 video camera. Recommended to me by a TV news cameraman because they used to use it in the roadway at Bathurst for the big race. The thing blew up in 14 months.
Worst service I ever experienced was trying to get this fixed at Canon service in Melbourne.

The first question they asked was did I get it serviced regularly? What the copulation does that matter when it was the power supply that blew up? How do you service a solid state power supply? Being an electronics sevice tech for 5 years I think I have a pretty good idea what servicing does and doesn't do. It's like the wing mirror falls off your car and they say ""did you keep the tyres pumped up? Huh?
So these idiots at Canon in Melbourne tell me it's going to be six months before they can get a part for a 14 month old camera that has hardly any use.
I said not good enough. Give me my money back then and I will go and buy a different brand camera.
A week later they offer me a replacement camera from their fine Canon stable. Not the Made in Japan model that I had but some piece of rubbish from Korea with a non adjustable view finder and half the features missing of my own camera, oh, and I can keep the accessories from my old camera. Wouldn't want to burden you with a new battery or power supply now would we?
So I stupidly said yeah over the phone and when it turned up I rang them up and said 'thanks for screwing me"" now when are you going to fix my camera and by the way you can have the piece of Korean rubbish back. So they said six months and were pretty annoyed that I wouldn't accept their genorousity of a brand new camera. It did get fixed within the month but the colour was like a rainbow every time I used it in other words they screwed it. Calling the service manager got me nowhere other than an earful of abuse so I said that I would tell everyone I know what rubbbish Canon is. I have done that for more than 10 years now. I reckon I have told a thousand people. If you read this you are one more. Don't buy a Canon and certainly don't expect service because you won't get any. The camera eventually carked it completely when all the capicitors dried up in it. I had great pleasure in throwing it off my balcony onto the four lane highway below.

Then, i filled up the complaint form on Canon's website and got a call from dealer's office to mail back the invoice and we would mail you the corrected invoice. i refused to mail and asked them to come and collect it. He too was without answer and hung up on me.

Took the camera out in to the field, using a mixture of lens, these being a 70/200F4L, 300f4L, 28/135IS and a Sigma 500F4.5, please note at this point all of these lens work a OK with the with the 50D & the 1D MKII.

On the MK III all I got was ""soft"" images no matter what I tried, called in to Canon RCC in Elstree to have the focus checked, the item was ready after 9 days, collected and paid for the item, before I left, I found out where I had asked them to fit a new focusing screen they had missed out doing so, so I waited whilst this was done.

When back out into the field again (wildlife) by the way, image quality no better, when back to Canon RCC and saw a team leader of was far from helpful, after a long ""debate"" he took the 300 and 500 lens upstairs to check the calibration, when he came down he informed me that the camera was back focusing by 5cm and it was fixed, I was not convinced and asked to do test shots outside, this request was met with a lot of resistance but finally he agree as a senior technician was in the building from head office.

I let him set the camera up on my tripod outside, he even measured the distance from the camera to the subject with a laser range finder, he tried a number of different setting and the then agreed the image qualify was still soft and that the job, now for the second time was still not right, so all the kit except the 500F4.5 is back at Canon.

I spoke to Sigma UK who`s attitude was much better, they said the could match the 500 to the 1D body but them it would not be any good with the other bodies, not a lot of good, what does it take to get through to Canon that the item has a focus issue!!

Funny thing, whilst I was waiting, I was taling to a guy who had to 5D`s MKII and guess what he had the same issue, he was told, wait for it , it was a power board issue

This lens must have had a manufacturers fault if it sustained impact damage, as there is no way that the lens hit the ground or chair with any real force.

I purchased an HF 200 Camcorder 2 years ago for roughly $800. It is outisde of warranty, but Canon has a service center you can ship your product to for repairs. You would expect a Canon product to last more than 2 years, but nothing is made well anymore. With that said, recently the camera only operates when plugged into the wall, and the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge. When I called Canon tech support they told me that the battery or the camera could be defective, they wouldn't ber able to tell unless I sent it in. Internet search shows that replacement batteries range from $15-$90. After speaking to Canon I figured my best bet was to have them look at it and let me know what the issue was before I wasted $ on a new battery. A few days after I shipped my camera to Canon I received a letter from them stating I should pay $285 to have the camera restored to factory condition, however the letter does not tell me what is wwrong with the camera. Now, I ask you, would you take your car to a mechanic and give him $ BEFORE he even tells you whats wrong and provides an estimate for the specific job, or would you expect to pay him AFTER he at least gives you an assessment of the problem and perfoemed the job? When I called the 866 number on the letter after reading the letter I spoke to a supervisor at Canon who simply told me this was there procedure and the only option for their customers. So basically they take your $285 and THEN go ahead and look at the camera and figure out whats wrong. So if it happend to be that only the battery needed to be replaced, guess what, you just paid $285 for a battery. This is simply unaccepltable. I understand why they want the money before they do the repair, but atleast look at the camera and tell me what's WRONG first!! I paid the cost to ship the camara to them, the least they can do is look at it and give me a fair estimate for the work involved. I guess it goes to show you that Canon does NOT build their products to last, and the support provided to customers is in the realm of a 'used car lot'.

I have a serious quality problem with Canon Pixma IP4850 printer from the beginning of first use. I couldn't solve this problem for three months.

I bought a Canon Pixma IP4850 printer from your authorized seller Bimeks Forum in Izmir (Turkey) with two years warranty, but from the beginning of first use there is an unacceptable vertical line (distortion) for about 1 cm thickness at the right side of each paper.

I sent the product to the Canon Technical Service (Servus; www.servus.com.tr) two times for changing with the new one. At the first time they told me that there was no problem and send me back without doing nothing. It takes one month long, then I sent it back again second times. They told me that it was repaired. It takes another one month long again too. Then I called the customer support of Servus and I told them I couldn't accept this repaired product. I bought it as a new and from the beginning of first use there is a problem, so I need a new one. Then they told me that your request would be considered within 3-5 days, but nobody has contacted with me. Now they are telling to me that there is no problem with your printer and they changed their system record (60099024) from ""repaired"" to ""delivered"". They told me that your printer was not repaired. This status can be checked from the internet (www.yaziciminnesivar.com) The product is still waiting in the store (Bimeks) now.

As a result, This kind of behaviors are not well-intentioned. Canon Customer Service in Turkey is not deserved to be a part of Canon brand. Canon brand and customers are damaging such a this kind of behaviors.

And they viewed the image with conformation that “They are Getting Blurred”.

I want canon to be known that I had bought 14 MP PSA 2200 Camera for better resolution and better picture quality but I am very unsatisfied with the results provided to me by this camera. “Canon is not fulfilling the promises done about the picture quality and resolution”. I do have another piece of canon which is 7.1 MP Canon Power Shot A470 which provide the Excellent images when ever captured and also with finest details and clarity which is not seen to me in newly bought piece so if I won’t be able to get better picture then my old cam then what’s the reason for me to buy the new cam its totally hopeless and I am very unsatisfied by PSA 2200.

I am sending you the pic’s captured by both the camera’s at the same time and place with same vision in front of camera and also without any extra lightening and all so “lets the pictures speaks the truth” You can compare both of them as you wish even you can compare them by zooming them to the full extent into your PC and let me get known kind heartedly about the best one in both…..

Also I am sending you the “Voice Recording” for the conversation held between your employ and me regarding the fault is concern you can hear this conversation and hear the kind of speech and words used by your employ when we talked regarding the fault and he told us that he can’t do the Cash Back as per company’s policies and want us to keep the camera with him for “ 3 Long Days ” and your employ want my Brand new camera to be screwed to search where the problem actually is…..???

Basically I don’t want my new cam to be screwed for unnecessary reason because I had bought this camera after spending 5330/- Rupees. “I want better Replacement as per my choice and functions or otherwise I want Cash back” do what so ever seems to be better for you.

I also wants canon to know that the basic comparison of picture quality, sharpness, resolution, colors, contrast was being compared with no other brand then canon itself.

So what is want is to give me “CASHBACK” so that I can prefer some other brands (i.e. Nikon/Sony) so that I can get the quality what I want.

And also your employs doesn’t have any sense to talk with the customer regarding the fault is concern and they doesn’t provide the qualitative feedback for the genuine reason.

I want you to hear the recorded conversation which was recorded at canon shop on 07/04/2012 at 7:30 pm to 8:00 pm. & the person in conversation are Hitesh Chevli (Customer) and your employ Sunil Sonar (Owner/Employ….???). And he also refused to provide a written sheet for not giving the Cash Back also when we asked him to provide the mail id of some concerned person he immediately refused to give their ID and Phone No.

Basically he doesn’t want us to write our query to you b’coz he’s really afraid…..!!!
Your employ also challenged us to fight against the company’s premises.
If my Problem is not solved within 2 big days I’ll definitely forward this conversation and mail to “Media” and also provide Canon to have the best publicity ever being done by Canon itself.

I don’t know whether this publicity will be afforded by canon or not…..!!!

I want you to contact me on my phone no. : +91 9228121587 as soon as possible. I am writing this letter and sending you the attachment on the same day night around 11:00 pm to know whether company’s employ are reading mails or their mail id’s are just for showing that we solve problems but basically it’s all fake and unrealistic & simple terms of fooling the Genuine Customers for unwanted reasons….!!!

I am eagerly waiting for your call…..!!!

Warm Regards,
-Hitesh Chevli.",neg
273,3/25/12 8:22AM,"I have Canon S100 got Lense error during taking shots. Taken to Service Center MBK and was told that I must pay 8000 baht for replacement of lense (not even take a look at what is wrong with it) and later I ask to take to just a look before give answer. The Second answer was still has to replace and also you do not has warrantee!? it made me think that I really should not buy a warrantee product just get from street because Canon will always blame all problems on customer falts with very limited warranty it is very sad that I have this camera for just a few weeks. Also just incident I met another customer (French) has the same problems and been treated the same way but worse that he bought it second time same model but only last for 2 days before the second one broken. Well I never has problem with any Canon product thats why I never experience Canon Service, now I know, never to buy from Canon Shop.",neg
274,3/17/12 5:52AM,"Canon is one of the most iron-fisted of any company I have dealt with in over 25 years of business. They are completely insensitive to small business. They will add unjustified and fictional fees to a customer account on short notice then turn it over to collection. They are not worthy of any good support by customers, banks or the business community. They need a complete overhaul in order to save the good name of the Canon camera-lens upon which the company was first based. Canon, save yourself by coming clean. And, oh, by the way, your rep in Montreal who says ""the recession is over"" and that busiensses have lots of money, WAKE UP!",neg

300,11/16/21 8:43PM,"Canon has among the BEST customer service I have ever dealt with! For one, since they are based in the US, their workers are all fluent in English and technical terminology, and shipping times are fast. Their products also tend to be very reliable, so I have rarely ever needed to call them, but when I HAVE, they have taken care of issues instantly.

For example, I had some questions about my camera and its body handling. As I called, the customer service agent had the same camera in his hands, and he walked me through each thing he was doing and had me replicate it.

Second, we purchased a laser printer that was making a weird noise. We called a few months later and they replaced it with a refurbished model. That one was also making the noise, so they gave us a brand new one after they connected us with a senior team!

They are also very easy to reach via phone or email, and all responses are kind and professional. Have never had a single negative experience with Canon!",pos

Canon technical support, after some discussion, agreed to overnight another one even though it was past their normal one month replacement period (I was trying to be prepared so bought the cartridge before absolutely needing it and was out of town part of that time).

However the second replacement cartridge they sent was a starter low-capacity version versus the high-capacity, which was disappointing. I noted all this on the Canon online survey and literally within minutes received a call from a supervisor who said they will overnight a high-capacity cartridge! I have otherwise had excellent service from Canon for many years and this example shows why my next laser copier will also be a Canon. All companies should provide this level of service!",pos

I can't say enough about how helpful he was!",pos
313,10/7/18 9:52AM,"I am very pleased with Canon customer service. I didn't always get the help I hoped for, but their solutions to my problems were more than reasonable. In one case, my MF laser printer rejected a new Canon cartridge. The printer had been used little, but was out of warranty. They sent a new cartridge overnight, but the problem wasn't resolved. At that point, they felt the cost to repair would be more than the printer was worth. They offered a very good upgrade price on a newer model. Because the printer had been used very little, I investigated further and concluded the problem was shipping damage that didn't show up until I tried to change the cartridge. Not Canon's fault. Just bad luck for me. They did everything reasonable to help.

In another case, after several years of use, the flash on my Canon SX50 quit working. Technical support made a couple of suggestions, but none worked. Again, the cost to just look at the camera would exceed the value. They offered an upgrade to a refurbished SX60 at a very good price, so I took it.

My third experience was my ""new"" SX60. I only had it a week, when my strap gave way and the camera hit the sidewalk with the lens out. The only visible damage was a very small scratch on front of the lens assembly. However, the lens would zoom in and out a few times before displaying a ""lens error"" and shutting down. I called technical support where they made a couple of suggestions that didn't help. Then they sent me a prepaid return shipping label to send the camera back. They evaluated the camera the same day and told me the damage was not covered by warranty, but for under $100 they would send me a new or refurbished camera. I agreed and within two days I had a replacement camera, within a week of when I originally damaged it. At first, I thought the strap that gave way was poorly designed, but I've since determined I attached the strap wrong. Should have read the instructions.",pos

He wouldn't leave me until I was able to print from my phone to my printer. I cried. I told him the frustration of what I had gone through. He was patient, professional, & was sensitive to the fact that I couldn't accomplished the fix on my own. I never received a survey of our session on the 17th of August 2018, but I wasn't going to not let Canon know how this young man got me back to being able to use my Canon Printer.

360,3/9/17 8:36PM,"Dillon from who knows where? Was one of the best customer service/Help Desk person I have spoken to in YEARS. Being a CE/CS/QA engineer and actually working on a help desk from time to time for some really OBSCURE UNIX/Digial equp. co. Software I was impressed. He did what I and many others from Canon have tried to do since Nov 2016. He was very professional and knowledgeable in many aspects of technology that I have lost touch with and actual have SHUNNED for years.

Sorry for the RANT this is about Dillon. Excellent is not even a superlative that can be used because he was more than that. Phenomenal? maybe. If you ever get him for a question and he spends 1 plus hours on the phone with you (the wife was in the back ground wanting to fix the problem herself) he will most likely get the job done. We had to take several different WORK around before we finally had a solution to the problem. SEEMS router engineers don't make it easy for any one to get there wps turned on. It is encoded of turned off in such a way that any normal (non-engineer, ever this engineer, me ) could not fix it. COME ON CABLE wake up. If I had been working and found that BUG you bet it would have been fixed. So kudos to DILLON, Thank you for the time spent and for the knowledge you imparted on me. Great JOB...oh and DT see you Rob F. Oh and I will most likely never read this or anyreplies to it....",pos

391,11/14/16 2:37PM,"11/14/2016 - Just off call with tech named Joel (no other info provided).

As a former online technician from several years ago and after working 23 years for an international computer corporation, I know what customer service and good technical support means, both to the corporation and to the customers.

I have just completed a technical call with Joel and must take the opportunity to grade him as five stars out of a possible 5 stars. Joel was articulate, patient, completely knowledgeable about my issues requiring a patch upgrade due to Win 10 incompatibility issue. There were several steps for upgrading the Canon app, getting new drivers downloaded and the patch installed correctly. Joel did a superb job in walking me through each part of the process AND explained why as we did it. He could have made assumptions about what I should know, he could have put me on hold while waiting for me to reboot the system, etc., etc. ... But, he stayed online, waited patiently, and proceeded when I was ready. By the way, I had to ask him how I could leave a review of our work today. I don't mind it when service personnel have asked me to leave comments in previous calls but I think it shows an extra level of class and professionalism to allow the customer to request that information.

So, kudos to Joel for a job extremely well done and kudos to Canon for doing it right.

This is why I hold Canon as my first go to for products...starting with the purchase of my first (and still working) Canon FT QL camera purchased at the PX in Danang, RVN in 1969.

Keep up the good work. Take care of your techs. This is not easy work and they are the first line after point of sale, to represent you to your customer base and the public.

Keep the Joels of your corporation and feed them well....I'll be looking for them in the future.

424,6/8/16 11:04AM,"A couple of years ago I bought a Canon Power Shot SC270HS and complained to you (phone and in )writing about the termination of the printed instruction manual.

HOWEVER,this is to underline the professionalism of 1 of your representatives. On May 28/29th, Photo Laplante, 350 Boul des Laurentides, Laval,Qc

held a sales and work shops. I love photography and my principal tools are: on/off button, zoom, macro... get my point? but I love taking pictures. I therefore seized the opportunity to ask a couple of questions to the Canon representative (unfortunately did not ask his name): he was so very nice, not condescending at all and explained everything simply, clearly and with a smile. So I would like to thank him and let you know how well he represented the company.

425,6/7/16 12:27PM,"Without giving me the opportunity to decline, my computer recently ""upgraded"" itself to Windows 10. In reality, so far, it's been more of a downgrade.

Afterward, I was unable to use my Canon printer. I took my laptop to the Geek Squad at Best Buy, but the representative told me that my printer was now obsolete and could not be added to Windows 10 - i.e., my only options were: 1) to have them try to reinstall Windows 7 (a 10-day process, that may or may not work and which, besides tying up my computer, would possibly cause me to lose data) or, 2) I could do the logical thing - purchase a new printer and toss a perfectly good one.


I chose a third option - call the Canon helpline, which I did yesterday. Two of the Canon reps (Natalia - Station #647) and Alicia (Station #659) talked me through the complicated process of removing and replacing my printer to accommodate Windows 10. Natalia worked with me initially and before we hung up (after about half-an-hour), we tested the printer for printing and scanning and all was well.

As soon as I hung up, the system affecting the printer froze. So, I placed another call to Canon and spoke with Alicia, who told me that that was also a common problem with Windows 10. She talked me through that process, as with the initial process was also complicated, and was able to get my printer back up and running after about another 15-20 minutes.

I am really impressed with the staff at Canon and cannot say enough good about how patient and cheerful both Natalia and Alicia were with me as we worked to correct this very aggravating problem. I don't know how they knew what they were doing, but I sure as Hell would never have had a clue about how to fix the problem on my own.

Special thanks to both ladies. They deserve raises or bonuses, or both!!!

Nancy Singh",pos

After conversing with David about my situation, he determined the problem was with the cord that attached my camera to the computer. I was VERY impressed with his knowledge and his step by step procedure to determine the problem in my situation. He retrieved the part number for a new cord, gave it to me and transferred me to sales whereby I ordered a new cord which I am hopeful will solve my problem. I am thankful that Canon has seen fit to hire such a knowledgeable person about computers and Canon products. WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",pos

The first was with the scan function, problem was resolved with one phone call; excellent service provided. The second was with the fax function, I spent more than an hour on the phone with technical support and the problem was not fully resolved. although the fax feature worked properly, the telephone priority was not set up properly as incoming phone calls were unanswerable as the caller received only a fax tone. I called again and ended up withe a tech support person who was rude, disinterested and i must say quite incompetent.

when i once again had the time to allocate to resolving this ongoing problem i called again. Quite fortunately I reached a tech support person By the name of Terrell (station x265). Terrell was patient, competent, technically proficient and went above and beyond any expectation I had in order to resolve the problem. He went through quite a number of questions before attempting problem resolution. Terrell inquired about the settings of bothe the MX92 and my Panasonic DECT 6.0 telephone system and associated answering machine. Asked to determine how the phone was connected to the wall jack or modem, he changed the settings on my MX922, which were erroneously set up by the previous tech support person I spoke with 2 weeks ago and then he asked about my answering machine settings. I told him I was unsure how to check and then he asked me for the model number of the Panasonic telephone/answering system and he went online to find the owners manual and quite proficiently and patiently walked me through the proper setup of the Panasonic telephone/answering system. Corrected me kindly and politely along the way and faxed me and called me several times along the way to ensure proper equipment operation. I must say Mr. Terrell,station x265 is an asset to your company and his methods and technical expertise deserve a resounding applause and commensurate award.",pos

490,9/23/15 7:14AM,"Some time ago I bought a refurbished Canon EOS 7D. It was around Christmas time 2 years ago. I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a refurb. I am not a professional photographer, but wanted a good camera to chronicle my family's adventures. Since Canon warrants their refurbished, like new, I figured that I could take a shot on a refurb. Almost two years later, this camera is still going strong. It was a little intimidating at first, but now, I truly love this camera. Save yourself a lot of money and check out the refurbs",pos

For some reason my order was cancelled.I called your customer service line and was able to talk with Travis. He looked at my order and confirmed it was cancelled. I was baffled, but I have had problems with online orders confusing my billing address with the shipping address. I chalked up my misfortune as to this being the possibility of the reason. TRAVIS offered some incite from his previous experiences. He was informative and empathetic. He then offered to inquire with his supervisor of my situation to see if I could still purchase the unit at the holiday sale pricing. He came back on line and informed me that he got authorization and that he could process my order. He confirmed the shipping and billing addresses. He took my order, he even informed me that the lens cap was on back order, allowing me to take this off my order for opportunity for purchase later. I am a manager at a national retailer. I deal with multiple types of customer and I do not play the game to try to get what I want. I was extremely pleased and grateful of the excellent customer service Travis afforded me. The camera was to be a gift of which my niece will get to enjoy. I can only say this as my complement to Travis, if I was dealing with him face to face and was given the service he gave. I would have given him my business and told him to come work at my store. Thank you for the outstanding customer service, Travis.",pos

Last night I contacted your Customer Service to obtain tech support to get my new Canon MG6620 printer installed.



I was connected to ""Chris"" - no last name available.



My new printer replaced an earlier Canon printer and was replaced; however, I could not seem in properly and quickly install it. Chris was the most efficient, courteous and technically proficient person that I have ever been connected with in my 84 years.



I would hope that my comments will be made aware to his supervisor. With people like him in your employ, Canon will gain many new customers!



I have submitted this review without any suggestion at all from your highly qualified customer service/tech support member.
