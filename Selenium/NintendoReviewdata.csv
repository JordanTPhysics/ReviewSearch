4,Nintendo,"This is in regards to the nes classic edition console. You people are shameless aren't you? Do you honestly believe you're fooling anyone with this ""we apologize for shortages"" nonsense? Even Forbes magazine has openly accused you of intentionally inflating demand by not producing enough. You say some of the parts are ""difficult to procure"". Are you kidding?! Thumb size computers, raspberry pie mini pc's, and cell phones from ten years ago can all run your roms but you can't seem to get your production rolling because of parts? You did this on purpose like you always do. Just like Apple, you make things people want but the way you do business is absolutely terrible. But you do it because you can, isn't that right?

11,Nintendo,"Sent my WiiU (gamepad and console) in for a repair due to the gamepad and the console not syncing properly. This started happening about 8 months after the system was purchased.

Repaired it quick and shipped it quick...problem is they shipped it to a location 2 states away from me. Called and confirmed that my address was correct in their system, and after a few days of waiting for them to figure out what happened they just sent me a replacement (not a new one, one that was ""factory certified"").


It has been a few weeks in the process now and I came home today to find the replacement WiiU sitting on my doorstep. Awesome. NOPE, not awesome. These boneheads sent me only the console, not realizing that when I sent it in for service I sent my console AND THE GAMEPAD. I now have a (used) console that looks nice and pretty but no way to use it. Now I have to wait even longer for them to send me a replacement gamepad. Not holding my breath on that actually coming to the right place or working properly with my hodge podge of parts and pieces I now have.

Oh, and when I asked for a refund of any or all of the service fee of $115 that I paid they really tried to make good by offering me $10 to be added to my account. Wow, great customer service.

17,Nintendo,"Summary: They have become a gimmicky company that generates income by tying accessories to the console.

We bought a used Wii-U off a third-party reseller and the LCD gamepad was busted. Since it is necessary to configure the console, we have been unable to use it.

That's perfectly fine, we knew the risks of buying used. However, for some unknown reason, the company does not sell the gamepad separately.

When we contacted customer support to attempt to repair/exchange the gamepad, they held onto for two weeks and ultimately told us they could not repair it, and could not exchange it.

So we asked if we could order a replacement from the company. They explained that it is against company policy to sell the replacement peripheral.

The only profitable incentive for them to do so is so that you're forced to buy another console, and to discourage the sale of used goods. This is not only terrible for the environment, but it is *terrible* for the consumer.

For this reason, I will make it a priority to get a used replacement and make sure they don't personally receive any of my money.",2015-10-06 16:06:00,neg

I find it somewhat wasteful because from all the calculations I have done I have worked out that one case can hold 32 game cartridges. Also that is a lot of wasted plastic because you have plastic layered around the case then the case itself and the paper artwork. My suggestion is to make a case that is just a little bigger than the game and put a little piece of folded paper that has a link to your website so that everyone that wants to read the ""heath and safety"" information they can find it there. Than by doing so you can help stop the waste of all the plastic and save yourself some money by ordering less plastic and paper. So to finish off I would like to say I love your games but not the packaging. Thank you for reading and I hope you take this into consideration.",2015-03-11 12:06:00,pos

My 3ds xl analog stick won't snap back into the center and when it did break I heard a snap so the rep for repair notice it was a physical issue. First it was about $135 which is a bit much but little low so I said I can't pay that now but I will surely do it in the future.

Then he said ""no problem"" but followed me with a price drop which was out of nowhere and said about $104 roughly then I'm like ""I still can't do it right now but thank you so much"" but then he said exactly these words ""It's surely not a problem Mr.XXXX but I can give you even a lower drop to say ... $80 and do not worry because this offer stands about 6 months! We want to keep people in the nintendo family...""

92,Nintendo,"I called Nintendo Customer Service twice today, after realizing I could possibly fix two major issues I've had (One of which was my fault, the other was not). The first call went nicely, I informed the employee of my issue: Super Paper Mario wouldn't load. He assisted me in solving this, but even though he came to the conclusion that I would have to purchase a new game, I found him to be friendly and helpful. He even went so far as to suggest I don't buy a copy from their website, as there were many places it could be bought from for cheaper, which I found to be very nice of him.
The second call was made because I had lost a 3DS XL with a Nintendo Network Account linked to it, so I was worried that if it were found, it could be abused. This time I was put on hold for maybe a minute or two, when a nice lady picked up my call and assisted me. I gave her some information, and then was put on hold again, for maybe 2 minutes. After that, she checked to see if I was still there, gave me a little bit more information on what she was doing, then put me on hold again. I was only on hold for about a minute before she picked up again and helped me with my issue, step by step.

100,Nintendo,"I have mixed feelings about my customer service experience with Nintendo.

First off, let me say that I LOVE Nintendo products. Over the years we have purchased and owned every single console that they have released without incident. So I was confident I was making the right choice when I decided to buy my daughter a Nintendo DSi for Christmas.

At first, it worked as expected, but after a month of owning it we went to play a newly purchased game and the console was not recognizing that a game cartridge was inserted. We tried other games that had previously worked, and got the same response.

I looked online to see if there were any remedies and was directed to call customer service, which I did. I spoke to a wonderful woman who was extremely helpful and understanding. and instructed me on how to submit the DSi for repair. So that particular customer service experience with Nintendo was extremely pleasant and positive.

Fast forward a week. I checked my inbox and noticed I had an e-mail from Nintendo stating that the reason for the DSi not recognizing games was deemed to be physical damage and they wanted $95.00 in order to fix it and ship it back. This presented 2 issues.

#1. I knew there was no way my child could have physically damaged the system as she was never permitted to play with the system unless supervised by myself or my husband.

#2. The $95 repair fee is obscene considering the that the actual retail price of the unit is $99, and they can often be found on sale as low as $69 (what I paid).

I called customer service to get information on what issues they found that lead them to believe that the system was physically damaged.

I spoke to a man who was professional enough, but quite condescending in that he basically made me feel like a villain and told me in not so many words that one way or another we broke the console and would be responsible for the costs.

I stated that wasn't a satisfactory resolution given the above, he offered to take $20 off the repair fee, which would have still left me paying $75....still more than I paid to purchase the console.

He said that was all he could do for me, so I requested to speak to someone who could do more for me and was put on hold for his supervisor.

I must state that during the entire conversation I was extremely pleasant and calm, but firm.

The same customer service representative came back after a few minutes of me being on hold and notified me that he has spoken with his supervisor and was authorized to do a one time Non-Warranty repair at no cost to us.

I am extremely pleased that that was the final outcome, but displeased that I was made to feel like I was somehow scamming the company. It's faithful customers such as myself who continue to pour money into the company that keep a company such as this one thriving. To insult and alienate us does nothing to secure future customer and brand loyalty.",2013-02-06 11:55:00,pos
