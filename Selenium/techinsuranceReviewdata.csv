I had to get the insurance but I never got a renewal notice and I forgot about it. I didn't even know it expired. I chose TechInsurance over other technology-related insurance providers with price being a big factor. I spoke to the broker who was okay. The guidance was okay as well, but I haven’t really used the insurance. Now, I wonder if TechInsurance has any benefit similar to if one has AAA then they get discounts on certain things.",2018-05-06,3,0

They also seemed to understand my line of business and have the type of insurance that I needed. I started with an online application and I had an agent email me after that. The agent recommended a couple of different options and I purchased two types of insurance through them. I had questions in both instances and their agents were very helpful in answering the questions through email or on the phone. The insurance was something that my clients wanted to see that I have. It also me gives some of peace of mind to have some of those things covered. I'd tell people to go to TechInsurance’s website and see if it works for them.,2018-04-19,5,0

That was going to be a sticking point to signing up some new businesses. My previous attempts to figure out how much insurance would cost were very discouraging so I had put it off until a later date. A colleague suggested that if I was looking for business insurance then TechInsurance would be a good company to talk to. The first person I talked to was a local business insurance agent near my home, but they didn't really understand my business at all. Whereas, TechInsurance seemed to be focused on the technology fields, software people, information technology, engineers and the like. It was a big help that they were familiar with the issues in my business.

The guidance I received from the rep was excellent, or even beyond that.
