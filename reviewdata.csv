7/11/21 11:21AM,Issues with dish and Netflix is not the customers fault or reason to have to bend to what Netflix wants to make things easier for them. Customers who pay for services should have them running as smoothly as monthly payments are charged to them as the customer. But y'all pass blame on each other and the people giving you money for services monthly is crapped on and giving troubleshooting ideas which is just a circle jerk party. Disclaimers 7 be nice to know what we are getting into as dual service subscribers.,neg

11/9/20 6:55PM,"I have been with Netflix since before they were popular. A loyal customer that wished to see them succeed. Today I came to find that my same account that I used to pay $5.99 a month for, it might have been even cheaper, was now at $8. I used to be able to watch on multiple screens at the same time as well, and that is actually where the negative review comes from. I am fine with a little price raise but to get my same service I ised to have for $5.99 they want me to pay over $14 a month or $168 / year! I asked them to simply honor my legacy loyal customer status and was treated like a piece of trash. They just repeated the current prices and said if I wanted what I ised to have I had to pay up. They also made it clear they did not care that I helped them climb to where they are today. Horrible business. They will become the next cable company.
I already get three free Netflix accounts through T Mobile but kept my original account because I thought they were still a good company and like an idiot felt I should support them. I am now cancelling my Netflix account and using my free ones. I will never again pay a penny to Netflix, I hope they go bankrupt and will support their competitors from now on.

Customers should be treated right. Supporting behavior like Netflix has will only make it worse.",neg

Once again Netflix was contacted and they requested we change our information a second time. When asked how would they assure the account would not be hacked with yet a third email, credit card, etc.... the Netflix representative assured us this happens frequently and they could not provude such safeties. We explained we could not keep an account open that would not be safe.

5/10/17 3:12PM,I can never get any help from customer service by calling or using chat. They are clueless and can not understand anything you tell them. They will never tell you a feature is not available on their site and instead they waste your time by running around the issue and suggesting meaningless things to do that never resolves the problem. Netflix has no clue which movies you watched and rated and will continue to show you same movies you rated and watched and suggest you watch again (No i'm not talking about MY LIST) and their staff can not comprehend the issue.,neg

12/4/16 12:20AM,I hate Netflix.

The last email I received from them stated I had until the 14th of Dec to use their service but when I go to watch tonight it wasn't there. I wish someone could just listen to the phone call and see if i am making things up. This is so unfair and ridiculous I have to be treated like I'm not in tittle to something. I wouldn't even have known about the cancelation unless I called and that's not right. I'm not sure exactly how to contact someone else besides the phone call so I hope this reaches everyone that is thinking about signing up with them. What other company is better than them. I would join them just because I don't like Netflix!,neg

11/14/16 6:43PM,First of all their customer service can swear at you and make up anything they want and treat you like not allowed to say what I want with this customer complaint but you know the word I want to say right and second of all when they charge you for something they charge you for it and then apparently you're getting going to get ripped off because they're charging you for about $12 more that's coming out of your bank account Netflix is a scam problem is most of us did not look at things like I do not look at it for years and I just called them this month they rip us off and they still are money they promise you it causes this much they charge you for it which I really should but then they go to charge you for another fee which is about 3 times more and which most of us never see it but that happens apparently too much or regular,neg

I spoke to one rep who laughed it off when I tried to explain what happened. I finally hung up on him and called back and spoke to another rep who claimed my account would be forever cancelled and my credit card number blacklisted. I didn't believe her and asked to speak to a supervisor. Upon speaking the supervisor he assured me the money would be refunded to my account. I know of no one who could have renewed the subscription and have a feeling that Netflix renewed it on their end. I wonder if this has ever happened to anyone else.

A rep actually told me that 'having a language filter wouldn't allow users to operate the sight'. Huh? Further, he became condescending when I didn't agree.

Every experience I've had with the company has been bad, and their sight is poorly designed. The search engine seems like it was designed by a fifth grader (didn't mean to offend you, Fifth graders).

I will definitely cancel my membership before another billing cycle. How could a company that size be soooooooooooo poorly managed?",neg

8/9/16 3:12PM,"Hello- my issue is as follows - I contacted Netflix and asked them to please suspend my subscription, as I was going into the hospital for a lengthy period & would not be able to use the service. To be honest,I can't afford to pay for things that I'm not going to use. I sent my request in July, so, I thought, I would not receive Netflix the following month. But Netflix took it upon themselves to bill me for August and continue the service for another month. This irritates me, because I did not want Netflix, nor did I want to pay for it in August. That is why I made sure to contact them in July!!! Bad business practises in my view....makes me question whether or not I will resubscribe when I'm well enough to be back home.

I call netflix and they have no f***ing clue why they don't have the english audio for half of their Anime. Pisses me off. I only pay for streaming now and thinking about stopping that if Netflix doesn't get their crap together and start fixing things.,neg

4/30/16 4:24PM,"Been a while since I was subscribed to netflix, and thought I'd give it another try. I called customer service when I didn't see my old profile there. Well, it turns out that they delete user profiles if you don't renew your account within a certain time. What a way to welcome people back to your service, netflix, bravo! The customer service agent informed me that they remove this information 'to save storage space'. Now that's some bs right there. In this day and age storage capacity is economical enough to be able to save a person's basic profile info (favorite shows category, etc.) indefinitely at very negligible cost. There is absolutely no reason to remove the kilobyte (OR LESS) of storage space this information constitutes. Now 5 years of inactivity I can understand. Nobody wants a database that clogged. But 6 months to a year? C'mon, that's ridiculous. It's practically unprecedented. Why would I want to come back to a streaming service if the profile I took my time to set up has been deleted in such a cavalier fashion, with no legitimate reason? What a severe lack of common sense. Truly disgusting.",neg

I then scanned over a copy of my bank account, and i was told to wait 1 week, and the money would be returned. 10 days later,i call back and i get the run around once again. After sending my bank account information again, they tell me i have to have the bank call them, and i was told this after being on hold for almost 45 minutes. I should have know to trust my instinct and not try Netflix again. The same think happened to me before. The company has no problem taking your money, but when they make a mistake, and i forward all the information they refuse to return it.

3/24/16 12:33AM,"I have cancelled my Netflix account for the following reasons:
1. The service offered to Australian subscribers is just insulting.
2. They do not offer anything than cannot be found for free, or at reasonable costs, elsewhere.
3. They are way behind other online streaming services in terms of updating the latest content.
4. Forcing customers who use geo-blockers for privacy reasons, to turn their geo-blocker off, is just unacceptable. They don't have the right to expose their customers to harm or risk via the internet, nor do they have the right to infringe my right to privacy.
5. Their tech-support is just rubbish. In fact, they don't have tech-support at all - just pretend consultants who send your form responses, that have nothing to do with your queries. They are rude and condescending and generally jerk you around until you get sick of it, and either solve the issue yourself, or you cancel your account.
6. It's not good value for money - the act as thought they are completely unaware of all the competition they have with online streaming service.",neg

2/29/16 11:39AM,"Dear Mr. Hastings,

I love Netflix. My family and I watch Netflix all the time and we love it. However, I would like to say that when I go to watch a new season of my favorite T.V. shows it is not on Netflix so I have to wait for a few months for the new seasons to come on so I rarely use Netflix until the new seasons come on.

A solution to this problem is to add the episodes a few at a time so people will use Netflix because they will have a few episodes of their favorite T.V. shows and they will use your company's products and they will keep the contract they have with you and keep it payed.


When these shows come out people might not be able to watch or record these shows so they rely on Netflix to have the shows the want and then people find out that they new episodes are not going to be uploaded on Netflix until weeks to a few months after. Netflix is a good company and has 64,ooo,ooo subscribers and I know that you would not like to lose the people that use your website so I think that it would be a good idea to add a few shows of new seasons at a time so users will not stop using your program.

I hope you take this into consideration.

Sincerely,





Chaya Houghtaling",neg

2/18/16 11:07PM,Spoke with customer service today regarding different tax rates applied to my monthly streaming and DVD rental subscription which should be the same but for some reason they keep charging me a higher percentage on my DVDs which also changes every so many months and never stays the same even though the tax rate where I live has not changed. All I got was a run around that they just apply the rate that they are given when in fact I know that can't be true since I checked the tax rates for the county that I live in and it is the same for all services and the streaming tax is correct but I still could not get them to understand. They did not seem to care and that makes me think that they really know what they are doing and only act like they have tried to help you. I would not recommend their service to anyone and will more then likely will be a former customer once I get this issue resolved by other means as who knows how many other people they are or have done this to.,neg

2/11/16 7:17PM,"Someone hacked my account (I assume from France or a French speaking country, because they changed my account settings to French) and I only found out when I received an email saying that my email had been changed and I wasn't able to log in. I called customer service and the service rep courteously complied, reset my password back to what it was, and sent me an email (still in French) for me to reset my password. When I asked what the email had been switched to, I was told that I was not allowed to have that information (from my own account) per company policy, and was then passed off to her manager, supposedly Mike (with no last name -1010146) who then accused me of being the person who hacked my account (even though I had just verified my own credit info to get the account switched back) and suggested that giving me that email would incur some sort of (imaginary) liability onto them or Netflix, and told me it probably wasn't a valid email address anyway (he did a lot of BS lying), even though (as I told him), there is no possible way that the hacker could have used a fake email, as for them to have logged in and changed everything as they did, they would have had to use the password reset that was emailed to that address (A Netflix Customer Service Rep doesn't know this? Hmmm...). Instead of giving me the information I asked for (and there was no legitimate reason for him not to) he just made up one obvious lie after another to the point I felt like screaming. On top of this, once I had logged into my account (and changed the language setting back to English), I found that my plan had been upped to the premium package along with the DVD rental, and the service rep hadn't even bothered to tell me that! If I hadn't looked, I would have just been surprised when I got a bigger bill charged to my account. Unfortunately, the hacker hadn't yet changed the address to where the DVDs were set to go yet, so I wasn't able to find out who they were that way either. Yet I'll probably still get a bigger bill this month because of the change, and the fact that I have no intention of dialing customer support again. Apparently, it is official Netflix policy that they would rather protect the identity of thieving criminals than that of their own customers. I think I'll make that ex-customer.

1/31/16 9:03PM,"I am furious with Netflix! I have been a customer for years and ever since they changed their website my account has crumbled by choices. I no longer can add movies from the computer, I can only add on the tv, the problem with that is, that I can only choose from 50 movies at a time, and most movies are in every category, which the categories that netflix chooses, not me, because for some reason neflix seems to think that I am watching movies that I am not, and then there is a category for movies like the movie I watched but really didn't. So, I have mostly an entire screen of stuff I specifically told netflix I hate, and these are my choices. Who took over my likes and dislikes? Why did this happen? Isn't it wrong to say that there are 1,000's of movies to choose from, when your only allowing me to see what you put on my screen? I have a very specific watching preferences, and I now have mostly movies I will never watch, and that reminds me, I now I can't access my preferences. Oh yeah you say go to the preferences, well I do click, and nothing happens. This is wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole idea of netflix was to go online, actually look through possible movie interests, click on the add to my list and watch. Well you took away my right to add online, you took away my right to look through your 1,000's of movies, and you completely disregard any of my preferences. WHAT IS GOING ON? I am a person of low income as I am now disabled and cannot work, netflix is my entertainment, and I feel that whoever made the changes they did, just totally wiped out everything I had built up to this point. The movies that I do have on my list are constantly being scrambled and mixed up, so every time I go to my list I have to scroll to find the same movie. It is never in the same pace. I know their is now way I have extinguished all of netflix movies by a long shot, yet I hardly ever see any new ones, and all I am able to see are the selected 50 that you choose to let me see. I do know there is a name for this, and we all know what it is. I used to love seeing my options, now it is just a chore to see any new ones.I am ranting on this website as I want to have this problem fixed and to see if anyone else is having the same issues.",neg

Your business model is poor, I am sure you get lots of people that pay without a thought of what's behind the serice you provide. I have done some research and have decided to put Netflix in my rear view. I am one customer, and I am sure Netflix management could care less. Although, Netflix management should consider this, I have read the blogs from your existing and former employees. I can not support a business that has a worse over all customer service rating than AT&T as well as a lot of very un-happy employees. If this is even being read, and not being deleted the second it hits your email inbox then you should listen up. Your customer service is horrible, your punk male call center agent needs some training. I have read several posts that your culture is to just fire and re-hire someone else. That's how you solve the issue, really? Your culture issue is disturbing, avaya dwarfs your company and I am proud to say I don't experience the crap I have read from your current and fired employees.

12/16/15 8:05PM,"I guess the holiday season will be my annual time that I am frustrated by Netflix. For years, I brought multiple year subscriptions for others right before Xmas. Last year when I went to buy several, I found they were no longer available-just gift cards for set amounts which do not equal the amounts for any monthly subscriptions. Unfortunately, I put my credit number on the various accounts and ran into multiple problems. I lost one credit card and had to find out which accounts were linked to it. One account was for an older women who moved Canada and her granddaughter continued to live in her house so felt compelled to keep up the payments, and on the recipients added a DVD plan to what was supposed to be just a streaming plan. This year, Netflix does allow you to get a gift certificate in any amount. The problem is that the gifts are in different localities and I now have to calculate the state taxes for each.

1/21/16 7:57PM,"I've been a Netflix subscriber for 8 years. I had a contact with Netflix customer service tech support tonight, the second time I have had need for tech support in past 4 months. In both instances, I was shocked by the extremely high quality of their tech support. In an age when ""customer service"" is a very poorly understood concept, Netflix tech support greatly exceeded my expectations. The tech support guy tonight, Zachary, solved my problem within 10 minutes. I don't recall the name of the support guy 4 months ago but he was equally brilliant, helpful and customer oriented.

Whatever else may be said about Netflix as a corporation-- their billing practices, their industry affiliations, whatever-- I can say with out a doubt their tech support is TOP Notch, Grade A, Blue Ribbon, top shelf. In the 2 interactions I have had with them; I can say that the staff is extremely competent, professional, intelligent, professional, courteous, and most important... they SOLVED MY PROBLEM. In both instances the problem was NOT a Netflix-caused problem. But they solved it anyway, to help me enjoy their service.

These employees won't last long. They are too intelligent, competent and skilled to last long in tech support. Pretty soon they will move on to positions that are better compensated, which they richly deserve.

I just wish the Netflix tech support management would be hired as consultants to many many many many other enterprises.

6/11/15 1:51AM,"8.00-12.99+tax. A month.
Every other service moves their libraries too, or doesnt share.

10 years ago, I gave up on cable.
5 years ago, I picked up Netflix.
If I dont watch it in time, it may come back.
It may not. Depends on how selfish hollywood gets.
We should all share.

For 25 bucks at blockbuster you got unlimited dvds. Slowly they rolled out no fees.
Too late. They crumbled.

For the same price, you can get the mid level streaming and a dvd mailing service. Cancel and rejoin either anytime. Prepaid service.

Netflix ate blockbuster.your not going to find every movie you want. (Didnt get every movie you wanted everytime)
But there is a lot there.
Netflix will get it eventually.
Or another service wont share.

Netflix originals rock my world.
Marvel deals aplenty.

Netflix does everything it can to make it better, create content for everyone, and share.

Customer service is delightful. I was frustrated. I listened, it was fixed when I did what I needed to.
Educated me when I asked, or found my answer.
We tested a bit.
Turns out it was my connection.

When they are down, they post it at the help site. Honest.

I dont have to call often.
Get a good device. Smart tvs are clunky, wont get one again.regular hd tv is fine. Pick your picture quality.
Fire tv. Love it.

10/21/14 10:17AM,"How many of those who complained really took the time to read the ""terms of use"" before signing up for Netflix..? NOT MANY
Netflix is a subscription based company which means they charge you every 30 days unless YOU cancel(just like a magazine)they will continue to charge you. It's funny that people who say they were charged for 2 years and didn't know? Netflix should NOT be accountable for you being irresponsible with YOUR MONEY! Also Netflix ONLY provides the(MOVIES)its not the company's fault your internet connection or device is not up to PAR. I've had Netflix for many years and never once had an issue with customer service or service. Great job NETFLIX!",pos

I would just like to say that your customer service was brillant. No only was the women that i was talking to lovely, but she was patient as our phone connection wasnt brillant!

6/21/14 11:05AM,I just got off the phone with customer service. My phone call was answered in about 30 seconds and I was greeted by a very pleasant and helpful man by the name of Tristen. He fixed my situation in not more than a minutes time and the conversation left me smiling and in an overall good mood. So I got his name again so I could take a minute to write this comment out as thanks for such a pleasant experience. The world we live in right now doesn't have enough of customer care employees like the gentleman I am referring to. Thank You again for such great service which is why I love being a netflix customer!,pos

1/14/14 4:38PM,"Oh and there are a lot of negative comments on here about Netflix, but anytime I have a problem which is rare, they quickly and kindly help me! I find something new to watch everyday, yes I watch tv everyday, good selection could have more but honestly you are paying 8 bucks a month that's less than a meal for two at mcdonalds! And it's a lot cheaper than cable! And it's stupid to get mad when they don't have a certain movie or show you want, idk how it works but I'm sure not everyone would be ok with their show or movie being on netflix for a bunch of people to watch for pretty much nothing example,, if Netflix had friends I wouldn't of bought it on DVD!",pos

8/26/13 6:19AM,"Working for netflix has good and bad things about. I see a lot of comments about money not being refunded or just one month being refunded. Some people get annoyed by it and i totally understand how that can be a problem, but when it all comes down to it, YOU YOURSELF SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE MONEY BEING TAKEN OUT OF ""YOUR"" ACCOUNT. So yes you were charged 12 months, it is not netflix's fault you just now realized your account wasn't cancelled. So keep track of your own financial issues and you will have no problems.",pos

3/12/13 3:39PM,"I think Netflix is great. Customer services are fantastic, they are so friendly over the phone, which personally I feel is difficult to find these days. Great for watching films or TV shows and very easy to use. Its the little things like the ""top 10 for you"" and ""Because you've watched"", and all the other categories, that make a difference. Its a lot easier to find a film you will enjoy, if you don't know what your looking for. I also like how it records your account, so if your watching a series and you watch it on your phone then your computer and it will catch up to were you last where on either device. Yeah some of the films are older, but there still great movies.

I can't actually complain about there service ,great value for money.",pos

The young man solved the problem right away. However, I was not satisfied in relation to the reason I had to make the call to customer service. The question should be rephrased, and I would prefer that the customer service agent ask the question so elaboration can be made.

Also, your customer service phone number should be on every Netflix screen. I had to do some hunting to find it.

8/3/12 6:04AM,"I have been a faithful customer for both streaming and DVD's. The only way to express an opinion to Netflix is by calling customer service who do a very good job, but unclear if comments are passed on to the powers that be. However, there is no vehicle for general customer comments. It seems like they do not care about their customers opinions or suggestions to improve the product. For one example, it is etremely difficult to determine which episodes of a seriers are available in streatming or DVD only.",pos
