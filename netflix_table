15w2020-11-09 18:55:00w"I have been with Netflix since before they were popular. A loyal customer that wished to see them succeed. Today I came to find that my same account that I used to pay $5.99 a month for, it might have been even cheaper, was now at $8. I used to be able to watch on multiple screens at the same time as well, and that is actually where the negative review comes from. I am fine with a little price raise but to get my same service I ised to have for $5.99 they want me to pay over $14 a month or $168 / year! I asked them to simply honor my legacy loyal customer status and was treated like a piece of trash. They just repeated the current prices and said if I wanted what I ised to have I had to pay up. They also made it clear they did not care that I helped them climb to where they are today. Horrible business. They will become the next cable company.
I already get three free Netflix accounts through T Mobile but kept my original account because I thought they were still a good company and like an idiot felt I should support them. I am now cancelling my Netflix account and using my free ones. I will never again pay a penny to Netflix, I hope they go bankrupt and will support their competitors from now on.

Well, it turns out that they delete user profiles if you don't renew your account within a certain time. What a way to welcome people back to your service, netflix, bravo! The customer service agent informed me that they remove this information 'to save storage space'. Now that's some bs right there. In this day and age storage capacity is economical enough to be able to save a person's basic profile info (favorite shows category, etc.) indefinitely at very negligible cost. There is absolutely no reason to remove the kilobyte (OR LESS) of storage space this information constitutes. Now 5 years of inactivity I can understand. Nobody wants a database that clogged. But 6 months to a year? C'mon, that's ridiculous. It's practically unprecedented.

108w2016-02-29 11:39:00w"Dear Mr. Hastings,

I love Netflix. My family and I watch Netflix all the time and we love it. However, I would like to say that when I go to watch a new season of my favorite T.V. shows it is not on Netflix so I have to wait for a few months for the new seasons to come on so I rarely use Netflix until the new seasons come on.

A solution to this problem is to add the episodes a few at a time so people will use Netflix because they will have a few episodes of their favorite T.V. shows and they will use your company's products and they will keep the contract they have with you and keep it payed.


When these shows come out people might not be able to watch or record these shows so they rely on Netflix to have the shows the want and then people find out that they new episodes are not going to be uploaded on Netflix until weeks to a few months after. Netflix is a good company and has 64,ooo,ooo subscribers and I know that you would not like to lose the people that use your website so I think that it would be a good idea to add a few shows of new seasons at a time so users will not stop using your program.

I hope you take this into consideration.

Sincerely,

113w2016-02-11 19:17:00w"Someone hacked my account (I assume from France or a French speaking country, because they changed my account settings to French) and I only found out when I received an email saying that my email had been changed and I wasn't able to log in. I called customer service and the service rep courteously complied, reset my password back to what it was, and sent me an email (still in French) for me to reset my password. When I asked what the email had been switched to, I was told that I was not allowed to have that information (from my own account) per company policy, and was then passed off to her manager, supposedly Mike (with no last name -1010146) who then accused me of being the person who hacked my account (even though I had just verified my own credit info to get the account switched back) and suggested that giving me that email would incur some sort of (imaginary) liability onto them or Netflix, and told me it probably wasn't a valid email address anyway (he did a lot of BS lying), even though (as I told him), there is no possible way that the hacker could have used a fake email, as for them to have logged in and changed everything as they did, they would have had to use the password reset that was emailed to that address (A Netflix Customer Service Rep doesn't know this? Hmmm...). Instead of giving me the information I asked for (and there was no legitimate reason for him not to) he just made up one obvious lie after another to the point I felt like screaming. On top of this, once I had logged into my account (and changed the language setting back to English), I found that my plan had been upped to the premium package along with the DVD rental, and the service rep hadn't even bothered to tell me that! If I hadn't looked, I would have just been surprised when I got a bigger bill charged to my account. Unfortunately, the hacker hadn't yet changed the address to where the DVDs were set to go yet, so I wasn't able to find out who they were that way either. Yet I'll probably still get a bigger bill this month because of the change, and the fact that I have no intention of dialing customer support again. Apparently, it is official Netflix policy that they would rather protect the identity of thieving criminals than that of their own customers. I think I'll make that ex-customer.

116w2016-01-31 21:03:00w"I am furious with Netflix! I have been a customer for years and ever since they changed their website my account has crumbled by choices. I no longer can add movies from the computer, I can only add on the tv, the problem with that is, that I can only choose from 50 movies at a time, and most movies are in every category, which the categories that netflix chooses, not me, because for some reason neflix seems to think that I am watching movies that I am not, and then there is a category for movies like the movie I watched but really didn't. So, I have mostly an entire screen of stuff I specifically told netflix I hate, and these are my choices. Who took over my likes and dislikes? Why did this happen? Isn't it wrong to say that there are 1,000's of movies to choose from, when your only allowing me to see what you put on my screen? I have a very specific watching preferences, and I now have mostly movies I will never watch, and that reminds me, I now I can't access my preferences. Oh yeah you say go to the preferences, well I do click, and nothing happens. This is wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole idea of netflix was to go online, actually look through possible movie interests, click on the add to my list and watch. Well you took away my right to add online, you took away my right to look through your 1,000's of movies, and you completely disregard any of my preferences. WHAT IS GOING ON? I am a person of low income as I am now disabled and cannot work, netflix is my entertainment, and I feel that whoever made the changes they did, just totally wiped out everything I had built up to this point. The movies that I do have on my list are constantly being scrambled and mixed up, so every time I go to my list I have to scroll to find the same movie. It is never in the same pace. I know their is now way I have extinguished all of netflix movies by a long shot, yet I hardly ever see any new ones, and all I am able to see are the selected 50 that you choose to let me see. I do know there is a name for this, and we all know what it is. I used to love seeing my options, now it is just a chore to see any new ones.I am ranting on this website as I want to have this problem fixed and to see if anyone else is having the same issues."wnegw0.01882778679653679w0.5075943587662339w"['furious', 'customer', 'year', 'ever', 'since', 'change', 'website', 'account', 'crumble', 'choice', 'nolonger', 'add', 'movie', 'computer', 'add', 'tv', 'problem', 'choose', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'every', 'category', 'category', 'chooses', 'reason', 'neflix', 'seem', 'think', 'watch', 'movie', 'category', 'movie', 'like', 'movie', 'watch', 'really', 'mostly', 'entire', 'screen', 'stuff', 'specifically', 'told', 'hate', 'choice', 'take', 'like', 'dislike', 'happen', 'wrong', 'say', 'movie', 'choose', 'allow', 'see', 'put', 'screen', 'specific', 'watch', 'preference', 'mostly', 'movie', 'never', 'watch', 'reminds', 'cant', 'access', 'preference', 'oh', 'yeah', 'say', 'go', 'preference', 'well', 'click', 'nothing', 'happens', 'wrong', 'whole', 'idea', 'go', 'online', 'actually', 'look', 'possible', 'movie', 'interest', 'click', 'add', 'list', 'watch', 'well', 'take', 'away', 'right', 'add', 'online', 'take', 'away', 'right', 'look', 'movie', 'completely', 'disregard', 'preference', 'go', 'person', 'low', 'income', 'disabled', 'work', 'entertainment', 'feel', 'whoever', 'make', 'change', 'totally', 'wipe', 'everything', 'built', 'point', 'movie', 'list', 'constantly', 'scramble', 'mixed', 'every', 'time', 'go', 'list', 'scroll', 'find', 'movie', 'never', 'pace', 'know', 'way', 'extinguish', 'movie', 'long', 'shot', 'yet', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'new', 'one', 'able', 'see', 'select', 'choose', 'let', 'see', 'know', 'name', 'know', 'use', 'love', 'see', 'option', 'chore', 'see', 'new', 'onesi', 'rant', 'website', 'want', 'problem', 'fix', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'issue']"

One account was for an older women who moved Canada and her granddaughter continued to live in her house so felt compelled to keep up the payments, and on the recipients added a DVD plan to what was supposed to be just a streaming plan.

The concept of Netflix is a great one; the user interface is a convoluted mess! Somebody must have just learned how to use Javascript and is now infatuated with it to the point of absurdity! That novice employee along with his/her supervisor or manager should be fired! They have no common sense.

Now t

It is now impossible to use the interface with any ease whatsoever. It was FAR BETTER years ago when it was without all the damned Javascript gimmicks! I don't need those idiots telling me things like ""... Because you watched so-and-so..."". It should be up to USERS to view what's available so that USERS can decide for themselves what they want to watch.

I cannot remember being so angry !!!! I have been a member of Netflix paying my subscription on a regular monthly basis by direct debit for years and you have the audacity to question my validity !!!!

I was asked three times to repeat my password to sign in tonight. Never before have I signed in..


I am a senior and have terrible arthritis in my hands and its another tiny keyboard to navigate.

You then tell me to change it. I do that on my computer. Your email says it is changed. I go back to my TV.

It refuses to recognise the new password. two hours have now been wasted.

My whole evening is ruined thanks to you.! I cannot watch Netflix which I am loyally paying for.

Your CEO was interviewed last week on TV. Very revealing.

I shall now write to him.



If I am, on this end of my email answering you, and at the TV, which receives your service, then for God's sake accept that not everyone is under twenty and computer literate nor can they handle today's technology '

Please take this as my authority to identify myself and don't give me any more grief.

Ask me security questions which only I know. Does that not make more sense than what you have just put me through ??? Banks are far more vulnerable but far more advanced and updated. Take some advice from their websites.

138w2015-11-03 10:27:00w"The concept of Netflix is a great one; the user interface is a convoluted mess! Somebody must have just learned how to use Javascript and is now infatuated with it to the point of absurdity! That novice employee along with his/her supervisor or manager should be fired! They have no common sense.

It is now impossible to use the interface with any ease whatsoever. It was FAR BETTER years ago when it was without all the damned Javascript gimmicks! I don't need those idiots telling me things like ""... Because you watched so-and-so..."". It should be up to USERS to view what's available so that USERS can decide for themselves what they want to watch.


Netflix's method of grouping things by carefully-worded headings is nothing more than gathering psychological profiles from users when they click to read descriptions and/or choose certain movies. I suppose that they are selling that data to some government ""Big Brother"" agency.

Also, I agree with ""Anonymous"" who posted the following in October, (the 4th?):
----------
""I see several categories, all saying there are 50 movies in each category BUT I would say that at least 1/2 if not more are listed in every category. So this really cuts the amount of movies that are available to us down to maybe,if we are lucky MAYBE 400 movies to choose from.""
----------

The old say ""If it ain't broke -- don't fix it!"" applies to Netflix and those children they hired who insist upon playing with the User Interface.


I called and talked for an hour about all these issues with some lady who PROMISED that she would do something about it. Yeah. Sure! That was weeks ago and the damned thing is still a mess! Netflix is getting worse each and every time some idiot ""thinks"" that they know how to improve it. Obviously, none of them have any professional training nor professional experience.

144w2015-09-20 07:03:00w"Yesterday we noticed that our Netflix account of over ten years was compromised. Someone had deleted all the non primary profiles, renamed my primary profile and added two new profiles. The names on the new profiles were Evar, Tulva and Sel. Of course I immediately changed my password and called customer service. I explained that my family's profiles were deleted after someone hacked my account and asked them to restore the original profiles so that we could retain over ten years worth of activity on these profiles. I was told that Netflix doesn't have this capability. This is a multi million dollar if not billion dollar a year company and they are telling me they don't back up user data. I also noticed that even though I had changed my password and checked the ""sign off all devices"" box that all of our other devices were still able to go into Netflix, watch movies and most disquieting of all, change the password and/or email address on my account. This was an Ipad, two Iphones, and Android phone and the PC in my living room. When I asked the customer support rep why this was I was told ""it takes 8 hours for the signal to be distributed to these other devices"". I questioned the tech as to why it takes something that travels the speed of light 8 hours to kick out other devices on my account. Pointing out that an 8 hour window is plenty of time for anyone that hacked my account to continue to make changes to it, including my password and email address and that this doesn't exactly instill much confidence in me the customer. At last I requested to speak to a supervisor. After explaining my issues to the supervisor and being told that I would be put on hold while he looked into my problems, I listened to the same songs for over five minutes before being transferred to a survey asking me if I was satisfied with the service I received. Then the robot voice said ""thank you, goodbye"" and the call ended. I called back, by this time it was discovered that even though I had changed the name on the primary profile from ""Evar"" to my own name, the Netflix navigation window was still referring to me as ""Evar"" as in ""Top Picks for Evar"" etc. When I called back I spoke with the same support rep I had in the first place and asked for him to put me through to his supervisor again. By the way the support rep was named ""Steven"" and his supervisor was named ""Al"" or ""Allen"". Again I was cut off and called back a third time. Got a support rep named ""Kevin"" this time and asked to speak to a Manager. Kevin asked me to provide details so he could escalate the call. After I gave him details he attempted to trouble shoot with me. I reminded him that he asked for details and that I gave them and wish to speak with his Manager. He put me on hold and ten minutes later I was talking to another Supervisor. I explained my issues again to this supervisor (for the fourth time now) and was told that it takes 8 hours for the system to kick out the other devices on my account. Again I insisted that this was an outrageous window of opportunity for hackers to continue to run rampant with my account. Meanwhile my wife and daughter were still on their devices, using all the original log in information to watch movies AND had access to the ""change password"" and ""change email"" forms on my account. My ""current"" password showing up on their devices as a series of dots, already filled in and the form just waiting for a ""new password"" to be added and underneath confirmed. I was again told that it will take 8 hours for the new log in information to work and for all devices to be booted out. I was also informed it would take 24 hours for my personal information on my primary profile to reflect my own name and not ""Evar"" on the navigation page.

So, to recap.

1. Lost four profiles worth of data (watched, rated etc. ) Netflix has no backups or ways to restore that. Big problem.

2. After my account was compromised by hackers it will take 8 hours to purge them from my account even after changing my password and email address. Enormous Problem. There is no excuse in the 21st century for such a delay.

3.

- All time classic movies are not there,if they are then they're not on there for a long time
- Why do u lot need to remove movies?can't u just keep on adding and not remove them?
- On ""My List"" why can't you have seperate lists for movies and TV shows,as currently there's too much congestion with the two mixed together
- Why can't you have your 5 red star rating AND/OR IMDB Rating(as I find this more accurate then ur own 5 red star ratings)?
- Why cant we upload whatever we're watching on our mobile devices to our smart TV'S?

The first 2 times I was understanding, but last week there was an issue with both the DVD I had and Netflix streaming. Wow, I pay for services I can't use? That's not right! I called customer service for each department, here are my pitiful experiences:

First, DVD customer service is NOT open after 8pm. Which is annoying because I don't settle in to watch my movies until after work, dinner, and dishes, at least 9pm. Now I have to call back in the morning, when I don't have time! Secondly, I've been told that the real problem is not the DVD disk, but it's my DVD BlueRay player. Really? Nothing is wrong with my BlueRay player. 2 out of 3 replacements played just fine, but 2 copies of Mission a Impossible III played for 25 to 30 minutes, then started skipping all over the place. Customer service reps were generally unhelpful, didn't ease my frustration and when I said ""cancel my service,"" they said ""ok."" Nothing to make things right (except to send me more broken disks), nothing to try to keep me satisfied, nothing to keep me as a customer. Wow! This is NOT the company Reed Hastings founded as I know it. What has happened?

Streaming services were also down during the time my DVDs wouldn't work. One rep one night told me they were having issues, that ""stuff"" happened and nothing they could do; I would just have to check back. The next night, still no streaming services. I called again. This rep told me they weren't having issues, it was my DVD player and it needed to be updated and reset to factory default settings. Umm, my player was already updated and I don't know how to ""reset to factory settings."" He told me to call the manufacturer. Again, no real help. And no recourse. I didn't do anything and a few days later I tried streaming services again - guess what? It was working. Now I'm feeling I was deceived. I told Netflix to cancel my streaming services too. And they just said, ""ok.""

How many actual movie are listed in my account for my family to watch?

I see several categories, all saying there are 50 movies in each category BUT I would say that at least 1/2 if not more are listed in every category. So this really cuts the amount of movies that are available to us down to maybe,if we are lucky MAYBE 400 movies to choose from.

Suggestion: make a category titled "" All Movies"" and list them in alphabetical order, like Crackel dose, so as to not waste our time hunting through duplicates.

Someone has used my email address when they created a netflix account. They put in their own VISA/ Bank card num and their name is Simone.

I tried to log in using my email (i thought i had signed up) but because this person has taken it I couldnt, therefore I changed my password and now this 'Simone' person wont be able to get into their account because its my email and password they need but the account is on their bank card.

If that makes sense?

Please help!! Maybe you could trace the card number and see who the real owner is?

Thank you for contacting Netflix customer support.

Here is the transcript from your recent chat with customer support:

Netflix Jade
Hi! (: Thanks for contacting your friends at Netflix, Jade here! Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?
You
I was hoping you can help me. I need an extension on the payment on my bill. As you can see I have been a good standing customer for a long time but have some financial difficulties right now.If you could wait a week or 2 after the bill is due to recive the automatic payment i would appreciate it. If not I need to cancel my subscription today
Netflix Jade
Ah, okay no problem! Let me take a look over the account and I'll do some digging to see what our options are! (:
You
thank you
Netflix Jade
No problem! Looking at the account I do see you are in good standing and we really appreciate that! Right now the best way to change the billing date would be to cancel the account and then restart it on the date you want to be billed, or when you have the funds available!
Netflix Jade
All your viewing activity, profiles, and ratings will be saved for you, so when you restart it'll be like you never even left!
You
ok cancle it today and we will be going with amazon prime instead. thanks
Netflix Jade
No problem! Would you like me to cancel the account for you?
You
please
Netflix Jade
Alrighty, that has been taken care of for you. If you ever do decide to come back you can just sign into this same account and restart it! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
You
nope

It seems at least 1/2 the movies we get anymore will screw up somewhere in the middle and we'll miss part of a chapter or more to freezing up. The discs themselves often show little or no wear which tells me it's a quality control issue from the manufacturer side.

Lately, we've been getting more and more discs that won't play at all. They won't even load in our bluray player. The last example was Interstellar. It wouldn't play so we asked for a new copy to be sent right away. That one showed up and wouldn't play either. I called the 800# to tell them about the problem and about how more and more of their discs have been faulty and they claimed it was the firmware on my DVD player, not their discs. I spent the next hour figuring out how to upgrade the firmware on my player and the movies STILL didn't work. I called to tell them they had a QC problem but they still claimed it was my player's problem. My wife and I got fed up and finally paid $5.95 to watch it in-demand through our cable service. The 3rd disc showed up several days later and, lo-and-behold, it worked just fine. I wanted to call Netflix and tell them they were wrong, but I didn't want to put myself through that mess again. I feel like they should have paid that $5.95.


Oh, by the way, the movie we have right now--Wild--won't play at all. It looks brand new.

When in two years my rate increases I will consider leaving because all comcast does and intends to keep doing is rip people off. They will swallow your company whole and It's too bad Netflix joined with such an unscrupulous corporation.

I can never have the same view of Netflix as I had prior to this horrible union it has made with a known predator.

I believe that all of the below stories of charging accounts wrongly occured within the time frame of your companies growing pains. It is our honest money that your company dishonestly took.

I found the following clip from an article Seeing RED published in Vanity Fair February 2012 interesting. This is a clip taken from the article written by Wiliam D Cohan.


Since this was not rocket science, it took about a nano-second for Netflix's 24 million or so customers to realize that they were being hit with a 60 percent price increase; what had once cost $10 a month would now cost $16. Even though the price to see a first-run movie in a theater on the nation's two coasts averages around $13 per ticket, the social networks and the blogosphere lit up with such instant fury you might have thought Hastings had dropped a nuclear device on his customers. Greg Heitzmann, a University of Missouri graduate, was typical of the nearly 13,000 people who went on the Netflix Blog to express their anger: ""To say the least, I am shocked and appalled at your recent behavior,"" Heitzmann wrote. ""Your nominal price increase, while unexpected, does not deter my loyalty. However, your mouthpiece Jessie Becker's presentation of this upcharge-as an added choice for my own benefit-insults my intelligence and reveals the breadth of your arrogance. Had I been treated like an adult and informed of these changes in a straightforward, honest manner, perhaps we could rekindle our spark. Unfortunately, this course of action is no longer available; your condescending and manipulative tone has irreparably ruined our relationship."" Heitzmann canceled his subscription. He was not alone. More than 800,000 Netflix subscribers dropped the service within months of the July announcement.

As customers continued to flee, Hastings leapt into the fray to try to explain. ""I messed up,"" he wrote on the Netflix Blog on September 18. ""I owe everyone an explanation. It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.""

""We weren't doing the price change to raise profits or something,"" he elaborated to me. ""We were doing it because we were so focused on becoming the streaming company and the global streaming company that we always wanted to be, and always have wanted to be."" He said that he sees the future of Netflix similarly to how big telephone companies see their futures in wireless, rather than in landline, phones. ""Most companies that are great at something-like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores-do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business,"" he wrote on the blog.

Hastings took the blame for the failure to communicate better with customers. ""In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,"" he wrote. ""But now I see that given the huge changes we have been recently making, I should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both. It wouldn't have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.""


Here is my story. My husband asked me about the Net Flex charges coming out of our checking account. I told him that after our last conversation about ""budget cuts"" I called to cancel the account with Net Flex via phone because the charges were going to double with the new pricing Netflix announced. Of course, Net Flex shows no record of this~ I went back into my archived emails and have not received any marketing materials via mail or email since the date of closing my account in 2012 So honestly,I considered this account closed. They continued to charge my account every month. Spoke to Home Office today and all they can do is say sorry and refund me 1 month. I asked politely to reconsider? look at my account do you see any activity? any emails to me? Even meet me half way? The answer reluctantly was sorry we don't but that is all we can do.

I found these too. Looks like I am not the only one. Customer service and long term profitability all rely on one thing~
HONESTY

I have been being charged twice every month on my credit card for Netflix service for 2 years now, ever since going to streaming instead of CDs. I called them and they said they only show that I was being charged once a month and said they searched their entire system and they have no other charges under my number. I called the credit card company and they investigated with me. They found that it had been going on since Jan. of 2012. This is now Jan. 2014. I didn't realize it had been that long. I procrastinated on this for a few months but they refuse to admit that they are double charging us. I cancelled that card number out of Netflix and we're still getting charged. I am out $191 so far, need to see if it comes through again this month. If someone decided to do a class action suit, I'm in as long as I don't have to lay out any more money.

Netflix has been double billing me for months (after I requested that the double billing be remedied). They were unable to find my double accounts via my name and had to check via the credit card #. They could have done this back in March when I called, but did not. They are now waffling about whether or not I will get a refund for anything else but last month's double billing. I will definitely cancel my membership if the refund is not for the complete amount. Especially since I've called about this problem already. This is not the way to keep customers.



Netflix over charged me for over a year by charging 2 different accounts even though one had no account activity on it. Once I finally realized it, I complained and was told they would only refund 2 months' worth of charges on one of the accounts. I told them to close the accounts so I would not be charged any more. After some time I wanted to sign up for Netflix to watch a show that is only available on cable which I don't have and Netflix. When I tried to sign up, I was told a permanent block was put on my debit card and my account was listed as having fraudulent activity. There was no fraudulent activity except on Netflix's account and I never told them to put a hold on my card. They refuse to take the block off of my card or take the fraud label off of the account. I suppose so they can try to justify overcharging me for so long.

The only people that will communicate with you are first level lackeys that keep repeating the same thing over and over. This company has horrible practices, horrible customer service, and no one who is willing to take responsibility for any errors they make. I understand I am just one of many who have been overcharged by this sham of a company and also not able to find someone who is willing to fix the problem. There's needs to be some oversight and investigation into Netflix."wnegw0.041043871252204586w0.4579014349847684w"['dear', 'mr', 'reed', 'hastings', 'hope', 'business', 'man', 'take', 'time', 'read',

I have service issues that are quite complex. I'm trying not to over-complicate things here but I am an expert network engineer (immodest but true) and tried to resolve issues with netflix performance.

After first telling them things like ""yes, I restarted"" and trying to bring the conversation up to a more realistic troubleshooting level I found they have no way to escalate an issue for further investigation. Essentially, they DONT want to solve it, just give the illusion they will.

Netflix wants to point the finger at 1)My isp
2)my equipment 3)sunspots and tides

As soon as you provide clear evidence that the problem is them, they turn really hostile!

They wont let you speak with any technical staff so you can at least use technical language.

They provide no tracking number, no trouble ticket number, no way to track your issues for future resolution or get any followup.

If you try to resolve issues through online chat, then call...they will have no record of anything you said or did through the chat--meaning chatting is a total waste of time. Just call for any hope of resolution.

They refuse (even after acknowledging issues)
to provide any service credit.

I had a contact with Netflix customer service tech support tonight, the second time I have had need for tech support in past 4 months. In both instances, I was shocked by the extremely high quality of their tech support. In an age when ""customer service"" is a very poorly understood concept, Netflix tech support greatly exceeded my expectations. The tech support guy tonight, Zachary, solved my problem within 10 minutes. I don't recall the name of the support guy 4 months ago but he was equally brilliant, helpful and customer oriented.

Whatever else may be said about Netflix as a corporation-- their billing practices, their industry affiliations, whatever-- I can say with out a doubt their tech support is TOP Notch, Grade A, Blue Ribbon, top shelf. In the 2 interactions I have had with them; I can say that the staff is extremely competent, professional, intelligent, professional, courteous, and most important... they SOLVED MY PROBLEM. In both instances the problem was NOT a Netflix-caused problem. But they solved it anyway, to help me enjoy their service.

These employees won't last long. They are too intelligent, competent and skilled to last long in tech support. Pretty soon they will move on to positions that are better compensated, which they richly deserve.

I just wish the Netflix tech support management would be hired as consultants to many many many many other enterprises.

Every other service moves their libraries too, or doesnt share.

10 years ago, I gave up on cable.
5 years ago, I picked up Netflix.
If I dont watch it in time, it may come back.
It may not. Depends on how selfish hollywood gets.
We should all share.

For 25 bucks at blockbuster you got unlimited dvds. Slowly they rolled out no fees.
Too late. They crumbled.

For the same price, you can get the mid level streaming and a dvd mailing service. Cancel and rejoin either anytime. Prepaid service.

Netflix ate blockbuster.your not going to find every movie you want. (Didnt get every movie you wanted everytime)
But there is a lot there.
Netflix will get it eventually.
Or another service wont share.

Netflix originals rock my world.
Marvel deals aplenty.

Netflix does everything it can to make it better, create content for everyone, and share.

Customer service is delightful. I was frustrated. I listened, it was fixed when I did what I needed to.
Educated me when I asked, or found my answer.
We tested a bit.
Turns out it was my connection.

When they are down, they post it at the help site. Honest.

I dont have to call often.
Get a good device. Smart tvs are clunky, wont get one again.regular hd tv is fine. Pick your picture quality.
Fire tv. Love it.


So in other words, they are getting better all the time.

After reading a number of complaints, it seems that most people complaining fall into one of three catagories. First, they can't read (terms & conditions). Two, they don't look beyond the new release section. Three, they expect way too much for their monthly fee.

474w2011-03-07 12:03:00w"I just want to sent a messege to all those unhappy people outhere.
I'm a netflix fun I pay $9.99 a mont,i been using netflix for more than three years now, way before they have intant streaming, i even start with the five unlimited movie deal for $17.99, i think it was a very good deal in comparizon with blockbuster.
after six months i cancel because i want to try blockbuster well it was olmost the same system experience,i try blockbuster for two months them i cancel. I never have any problem cancel with netflix or blockbuster.then i start using the so call red boxes, they are very convinience yeah but they olso have negative side too, like you got people waiting behind you and you cant take your time selecting the movie that you really want to wacth and sometimes they run out,when you return movies the box is full so you have to wait untill some one rent a movie for you to return your movie. now you see what i mean it is always something.

Ok lets compare:
Blockbuster: in stores $3.00/$4.00 or more per movie for 5 nigths. online $12.99 minimum a month +.99 rental per new releases.

Red Boxes: $1.25/$1.50 per movie per night...sometimes not enouth titles for every ones so you have to go to a diferent location.

Netflix: $8.99 per month unlimited + one movie in the mail,unlimited streaming video 24/7/365 days.up to six divices like : Laptops,PC,ps3 wii,ipad,iphones,itouch,Htc Windows 7 Phones and next the epad tablet by android and any streaming player boxes. netflix have others plans prices too.

to be honest netflix is the best thing that happeng online and to our economy.

people just do the math!
..the video quality is like dvd quality
why buy movies when you have your own video club online more then 90,000 titles to choose from,no more storage,no more damage dvd's, no more stolen or lost dvd's and no more trips to video clubs and if you have a streaming player box you can take it with you any where they have high speed wi-fi or internet connection.

there's so much to learn about netflix in the good way.
just read about it,learned,subscribe,enjoy...

Netflix you're the best, A 10+++.

sincerely,

I mean like complaining you don't like the movie. You think if you go eat somwhere and you don't like what you ordered, even though it was cooked right, that you should be able to ay ""I don't like this"" like a 2 year old and expect not to pay? and as for the phone number, it is there. I have had to call before, and I had no trouble finding it. Click on the contact us button, then on the next page click where it says call customer service.

I even sent back my friend's personal DVD instead of their disc and got like $10 back. Shipping has never been a problem, usually 2 days dude to my close location to one of their centers. So I don't know why people get so frustrated. If you know that sending two discs in the same envelope doesn't always work, then don't. But anyways- I haven't had problems with it.

I had a dvd that didn't work once and I went online to report it. The day after I got the bad one out in the mail I already had the new one which worked great.

I love the fact that I can keep them as long as I want and it doesn't cost me anymore than my monthly payment or that I can get as many as I can watch and return each month."wposw0.22904040404040404w0.5609327400994067w"['wonderful', 'way', 'rental', 'dvd', 'right', 'dvd', 'rental', 'store', 'near', 'allow', 'day', 'pay', 'certain', 'amount', 'per', 'day', 'return', 'time', 'return', 'dvd', 'usually', 'new', 'one', 'within', 'day', 'depend', 'love', 'follow', 'occasionally', 'thru', 'email', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'long', 'take', 'send', 'get', 'email', 'receive', 'dvd', 'work', 'go', 'online', 'report', 'day', 'get', 'bad', 'one', 'mail', 'already', 'new', 'one', 'work', 'great', 'love', 'fact', 'keep', 'long', 'want', 'cost', 'anymore', 'monthly', 'payment', 'many', 'watch', 'return', 'month']"

Also, anyone can get their phone number on the Internet. Maybe there was a problem at one time and I was just lucky never to have experienced it. Maybe folks have trouble getting the Netflix number when they call 411. If someone doesn't have a computer they can just ask someone they know who does.
